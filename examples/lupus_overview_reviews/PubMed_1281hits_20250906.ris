T1  - Autologous collagen-induced chondrogenesis with high tibial osteotomy for large 
SP  - 726
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary osteonecrosis (ON) of the knee poses a treatment challenge,  especially in young patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) requiring  ongoing steroid therapy. Joint-preserving options for large osteochondral defects  are limited, and there are no standardized protocols. CASE PRESENTATION: We  report the case of a 37-year-old female with a history of SLE and prior left  total knee arthroplasty who presented with severe right knee pain and a  progressive varus deformity. Imaging revealed a 4 x 2 cm osteochondral defect of  the medial femoral condyle with over 10 mm depth and an 8 degrees  varus alignment. Given  the patient's young age and preference to avoid arthroplasty, we performed a  combined medial opening high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and autologous  collagen-induced chondrogenesis (ACIC) with iliac crest bone grafting. The  procedure involved creation of large channels for graft placement and multiple  drillings, followed by atelocollagen mixture gel application to enhance cartilage  regeneration. The patient experienced progressive pain relief and functional  improvement, achieving full weight bearing by 3 months. However, crutch-assisted  ambulation was maintained until 6 months to reduce loading on the joint.  Radiographs at 3, 9, and 18 months demonstrated gradual medial joint space  widening. At 2-year follow-up, arthroscopic examination confirmed complete defect  coverage with regenerated cartilage. No major complications occurred. CONCLUSION:  Medial opening HTO combined with ACIC and autologous bone grafting may offer a  feasible single-stage, joint-preserving solution for large osteochondral defects  in steroid-induced secondary ON, expanding treatment options for young SLE  patients.

T1  - Efficacy and Safety of Biologics for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE): A 
SP  - 70
AB  - This study aimed to use Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy  and safety of biologics for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A comprehensive  and systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library,  EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, and WanFang Data) was conducted from 2014 to  September 2024. Our study only included randomized controlled trials with full  articles that enrolled adult SLE patients treated with biologics, in comparison  with standard therapy. The primary efficacy endpoints were SLE Responder Index 4  (SRI4) and BICLA (BILAG-Based Composite Lupus Assessment). The safety endpoints  were adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). R 4.4.3 and RStudio  were used to conduct the network meta-analysis. RevMan 5.4 was used to assess the  included literature. 29 randomized controlled trials with a total of 13,712  patients met the inclusion criteria. The network meta-analysis indicated that  compared with standard therapy, telitacicept (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.4-20.0)  demonstrated superior efficacy in achieving SRI4 response, deucravacitinib (OR  1.6, 95% CI 1.0-2.5), and anifrolumab (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3-2.0) all exhibited  significant BICLA response in moderate-to-severe SLE patients. Regarding safety,  it was observed that there were no significant statistical differences among the  various treatment options. Cluster analysis revealed that deucravacitinib  exhibited the best efficacy-safety profile. Deucravacitinib suggested a favorable  profile between efficacy and safety. Telitacicept showed the most pronounced  improvement in SRI-4 response, but was associated with higher rates of AEs and  SAEs, whereas anifrolumab and deucravacitinib displayed advantages in reducing  SAEs. For patients with elevated baseline IFN signatures, anti-type I interferon  biologics such as anifrolumab and sifalimumab are recommended to maximize  clinical benefits. The reliance on indirect comparisons necessitates cautious  interpretation of these findings, so further research should prioritize direct  head-to-head trials to validate the efficacy and safety profiles of these  biologics.

AB  - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) with hypoplastic marrow is a rare but  life-threatening presenting manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus  orbitopathy is also very rarely reported in the literature. We hereby report for  the first time a 19-year-old girl who had a unique combination of MAS, with  hypoplastic marrow and orbitopathy as a presenting feature of lupus. We discussed  in detail our patient's demographic characteristics, clinical features,  treatment, and outcome. Our patient responded well to high-dose glucocorticoids  along with 6 monthly doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide as per the modified  National Institute of Health protocol followed by tacrolimus as maintenance  treatment. Her prednisolone dose could be tapered to 7.5 mg daily after 8 months  of treatment. We made a search on PubMed and Scopus for a literature review. We  obtained 15 cases of MAS as a presenting feature in lupus, of which four had  associated hypoplastic marrow. Males and juvenile age groups were equally  affected with MAS as a presenting feature of lupus. Most of the patients  responded to high-dose glucocorticoids. Only one patient succumbed to MAS. We  also reviewed 14 cases of lupus orbitopathy with their clinical, and imaging  characteristics, treatment, and outcome. Females predominated in these cases with  the mean age being 43.6 years (SD +/- 16.9 years). Treatment with glucocorticoids  and immunosuppressive agents lead to complete resolution in most patients. The  diagnosis of MAS with orbitopathy as a presenting feature of lupus in a  19-year-old girl poses a diagnostic challenge and requires the prompt exclusion  of the common mimickers before initiation of aggressive immunosuppression.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by severe Guillain-Barre syndrome: case 
SP  - 1551448
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by immune-mediated multiple organ injuries in the setting of  autoimmunity to nuclear antigens. In rare cases, it can complicated by the damage  of peripheral nervous system, manifesting as Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).  Severe GBS as the initial presentation is highly infrequent and associated with  high disability and mortality rates, highlighting the importance of early  detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Herein, we reported a successfully treated  case of severe SLE-GBS in a 38-year-old male. Furthermore, we summarize the  clinical characteristics of severe SLE-GBS reported thus far and propose the  possibility of using medium-to-high dose corticosteroids in the acute progression  stage of SLE-GBS. This report provides valuable insights for the analysis of  disease characteristics and guidance for diagnosis and treatment of such cases.

T1  - Dual B-cell targeting in systemic lupus erythematosus: The role of combined and 
SP  - 103837
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized  by immune dysregulation and autoantibody production. Despite advances in  treatment, achieving sustained disease control remains challenging. Rituximab  (RTX) and belimumab (BELI) are two B-cell-targeting biologics with complementary  mechanisms of action, leading to increasing interest in their combination as a  therapeutic strategy for refractory SLE. RTX depletes CD20+ B cells, whereas BELI  inhibits B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), reducing the survival of autoreactive B  cells. Sequential therapy with these agents may mitigate B-cell repopulation and  improve disease control. Recent studies, including SynBioSe and BEAT-LUPUS,  suggest that RTX-BELI therapy can reduce autoantibody levels, neutrophil  extracellular trap formation, and disease activity, with many patients achieving  a lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS). However, the BLISS-BELIEVE and  CALIBRATE trials did not demonstrate superiority over monotherapy, highlighting  the need to refine patient selection. Combination therapy may be particularly  beneficial in lupus nephritis, where BELI delays autoreactive B-cell  reconstitution following RTX, potentially prolonging remission. While RTX-BELI  therapy is generally well-tolerated, some studies report increased infections,  necessitating careful patient monitoring. Lessons from other immune-mediated  diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis,  underscore the potential benefits and risks of dual biologic therapy. Further  research, including the ongoing SynBioSe-2 trial, is needed to clarify the  optimal use, sequencing, and safety profile of RTX-BELI in SLE. Identifying  biomarkers predictive of response may enable personalized treatment approaches,  ultimately improving long-term outcomes for patients with refractory SLE.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the potential of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T)  therapy in revolutionizing the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and to outline necessary future steps for its implementation.MethodsA careful  literature search was conducted for relevant English language papers on  pubmed.ResultsPreliminary data suggest that CAR-T therapy could significantly  improve SLE outcomes. Demonstrating remarkable clinical and serologic  improvements in SLE patients, with all treated patients achieving remission and  discontinuing conventional steroids and immunosuppressive drugs. To realize this  potential, it is imperative to advance our understanding and application of CAR-T  therapy. Rigorous research is necessary to validate current findings, and  clinical trials must be conducted to assess both the short- and long-term  efficacy and safety across diverse populations. Identifying appropriate patient  populations is crucial, as CAR-T may also address compliance issues. Despite its  current high cost, the financial burden is comparable to the long-term costs of  severe SLE treatment. Strategies to reduce costs, including production  efficiencies and outpatient treatment options, are under exploration. Early  intervention could enhance its feasibility and impact on long-term  prognosis.ConclusionCAR-T therapy holds promise for altering the prognosis of SLE  and potentially offering a cure. However, substantial efforts are required to  validate its efficacy, ensure safety, identify suitable patient cohorts, and  reduce financial barriers. This development represents an exciting advancement in  SLE treatment, necessitating urgent and focused research and clinical  application.

T1  - The efficacy of total hip arthroplasty in patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 381
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can lead to avascular necrosis  (AVN) of the femoral head, often requiring total hip arthroplasty (THA). However,  outcomes and complications of THA in SLE patients remain unclear. This study aims  to analyze the differences in clinical outcomes and complications between SLE and  non-SLE patients undergoing THA. METHODS: This study adhered to the PRISMA  guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024564792). Literature was  retrieved from the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase  databases, supplemented by manual searches of relevant references. Studies  meeting specific diagnostic criteria were included, with eligible study types  comprising case-control and cohort studies. The intervention of interest was THA  surgery, and primary outcome measures included adverse events and clinical  outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for  randomized trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies.  Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Dichotomous  variables were analyzed using relative risk (RR), while continuous variables were  assessed using the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD),  both with 95% confidence intervals for effect size estimation. Heterogeneity was  assessed via the X(2) test and I(2) statistic, with P </= 0.05 considered statistically  significant. RESULTS: No significant difference in Harris Hip Scores (HHS) (MD=  -0.69, 95% CI: -2.11 to 0.73, I(2)=0%, P = 0.34) was observed between SLE and  non-SLE patients. However, compared to non-SLE patients, SLE patients had higher  risks of prosthesis dislocation (RR = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.74 to 3.42, I(2)=52%,  P<0.01), wound infection (RR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.87 to 2.83, I(2)=0%, P<0.01), and  blood transfusion (RR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.14 to 2.92, I(2)=0%, P<0.01), as well as  longer hospital stays (MD = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.44 to 1.64, I(2)=100%, P<0.01).  DISCUSSION: In conclusion, although SLE patients show similar improvements in hip  function postoperatively compared to non-SLE patients, they face a significantly  higher risk of complications, including prosthetic dislocation, blood transfusion  requirements, DVT, and wound infections. These patients also experience longer  hospital stays and slower recovery, likely due to their underlying health  conditions and preoperative treatments. Personalized management strategies and  risk assessments are crucial to minimize complications and optimize recovery  outcomes for SLE patients undergoing THA. However, the included studies exhibit  significant heterogeneity, including variations in prosthesis types, fixation  methods, sample sizes, and study designs, which may introduce potential bias and  affect the generalizability of the findings. Further high-quality research is  needed to address these issues.

T1  - Lupus nephritis trials network (LNTN) repeat kidney biopsy-based definitions of 
SP  - 103810
AB  - Within the frame of the Lupus Nephritis Trials Network (LNTN), we conducted a  systematic literature review (SLR) to propose kidney tissue-based definitions of  treatment outcomes in lupus nephritis (LN). Given the limitations of clinical  markers like proteinuria in predicting immunological, histological, and long-term  outcomes, our work emphasises the importance of repeat kidney biopsies. Such  biopsies help identify discordance between clinical and histological response,  which has implications for long-term kidney outcomes. The research objectives of  this SLR focused on defining repeat biopsy-based treatment response and  histological remission, and their associations with long-term outcomes. The SLR  reviewed studies published from 2000 to 2022, identifying 20 eligible works.  Histological response was commonly defined by changes in the National Institutes  of Health (NIH) Activity Index (AI), with response indicated by a decrease of  >/=50 % and to </=3. Remission was most commonly defined as an AI score of 0. These  benchmarks were associated with improved long-term renal outcomes, such as  reduced flare rates and preserved kidney function. Conversely, NIH AI scores >/=4  and NIH Chronicity Index (CI) scores >/=4 were associated with poor prognosis,  highlighting their predictive utility. Consensus definitions were established  through expert panel deliberation, setting a foundation for standardising LN  treatment evaluation in clinical trials and observational studies. These  definitions are not intended for routine clinical decisions but aim to enhance  uniformity and comparability in research, especially when repeat kidney biopsies  are performed, an approach strongly advocated by our work. Further validation  through ongoing initiatives and molecular characterisation efforts will refine  these criteria, fostering advances in LN management and patient outcomes.

SP  - 1473190
AB  - Immune thrombocytopenia(ITP)is a common clinical manifestation of systemic lupus  erythematosus(SLE). Drug therapy includes glucocorticoids(GCs),disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics. Refractory thrombocytopenia can be  life-threatening, and the use of effective medications plays a crucial role in  disease improvement. Here, we report a case of ITP secondary to SLE. The use of  dexamethasone(DEX), cyclosporine A(CsA), and hetrombopag resulted in drug-induced  liver injury. Subsequently, telitacicept was chosen and successfully controlled  the patient's condition. It suggests that telitacicept may be a new treatment  option for refractory SLE-ITP.

T1  - Case Report: Nutcracker Syndrome Triggered by Rapid Weight Loss in a Patient With 
SP  - e70190
AB  - Nutcracker syndrome (NCS) is a rare vascular disorder characterized by  compression of the left renal vein, typically causing hematuria, proteinuria, and  flank pain. Although NCS is often linked with weight loss and anatomical  variations, no previous reports have connected it to systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). We describe a 44-year-old male with SLE who developed NCS after rapid  weight loss, presenting with abdominal pain, hematuria, and proteinuria. Imaging  confirmed left renal vein compression between the aorta and the superior  mesenteric artery. This finding suggests that significant weight reduction in SLE  may trigger NCS by altering retroperitoneal fat and vascular structures. A  literature review reveals a consistent association between NCS and marked weight  loss, as well as possible coexistence with other vascular compression syndromes,  such as superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Clinicians should consider NCS in  SLE patients with sudden weight changes to ensure timely diagnosis and prevent  complications.

T1  - Antiphospholipid syndrome presenting as isolated renal vein thrombosis: a case 
SP  - 123
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare systemic autoimmune  disorder characterized by recurrent thrombotic events in the presence of  antiphospholipid antibodies. Isolated right renal vein thrombosis resulting in a  nonfunctional kidney is an uncommon manifestation of antiphospholipid syndrome.  Here, we present our experience with antiphospholipid syndrome secondary to  systemic lupus erythematosus. CASE PRESENTATION: A 10 year-old girl from a Hindu  family in Sindh, Pakistan, who had previously been healthy, presented in 2020  with a 1-week history of abdominal pain, gross hematuria, vomiting, and fever. On  examination, she was anxious, febrile, hypertensive, and had an enlarged, tender  right kidney. Other systemic examinations, including skin, locomotor,  respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems, were unremarkable. Initial  investigations for ureteric colic and acute pyelonephritis were negative, but  revealed thrombocytopenia on complete blood count, mild proteinuria, hematuria on  urinalysis, and normal kidney and liver function tests, along with normal  prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times. An abdominal ultrasound  showed a diffusely enlarged, echogenic right kidney with a loss of  corticomedullary distinction and cortical hypoechoic areas, while the left kidney  appeared normal. Color Doppler ultrasound identified a large thrombus in the  right renal vein, completely obstructing its lumen and showing no blood flow. The  thrombus extended into the inferior vena cava. Computed tomography angiography  confirmed an organized thrombus completely blocking the right renal vein and  extending into the infrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava. No  prothrombotic risk factors were identified during clinical evaluation, and  thrombophilia screening was negative. However, lupus serology and  antiphospholipid antibodies were positive, confirming a diagnosis of secondary  antiphospholipid syndrome. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient was treated with  enoxaparin anticoagulation, later transitioned to warfarin sodium, and her  hypertension was managed with captopril and amlodipine. She showed gradual  improvement over 10-12 days and was discharged on anticoagulants,  antihypertensive medications, antiplatelet agents, and hydroxychloroquine. A  follow-up Doppler ultrasound revealed persistent blockage of the right renal vein  by the thrombus, with no thrombus in the inferior vena cava. A dimercaptosuccinic  acid scan indicated a nonfunctioning right kidney. While nephrectomy was  recommended, her parents declined the procedure. Anticoagulation therapy was  switched to rivaroxaban to avoid frequent international normalized ratio  monitoring. Her captopril was replaced after control of blood pressure with  losartan. Over the next 4 years, her follow-up was uneventful. She demonstrated  normal growth, stable blood pressure (off antihypertensive), and normal kidney  function without proteinuria. There were no lupus flares or thrombotic  recurrences. Her most recent urinalysis was normal, with a serum creatinine level  of 0.6 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate > 170 mL/min/1.73 m(2).  CONCLUSION: Isolated renal vein thrombosis is a rare presentation of  antiphospholipid syndrome and poses a diagnostic challenge in the absence of  preexisting prothrombotic risk factors. Early diagnosis and timely management are  crucial to prevent organ damage. In this case, the patient retained a solitary  functioning kidney. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for lupus flares,  thrombus recurrence, hypertension, proteinuria, and progression to chronic kidney  disease, as well as to ensure continued thromboprophylaxis.

T1  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus: an acquired autoimmune disease to be taken 
SP  - 2476049
AB  - AIM: This review aims to summarize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical  features, management, prognosis and regression of Neonatal lupus erythematosus  (NLE) with a view to providing directions for standardized diagnosis, treatment  and further research. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review of  NLE. NLE-related peer-reviewed papers were searched through PubMed/Medline were  searched up to November 2024. RESULTS: NLE is a rare acquired autoimmune disease  (AD) linked to organ damage from maternal autoantibodies crossing the placenta to  the foetus. However, not all mothers have ADs or associated antibodies. The  disease involves autoantibody-induced inflammation, apoptosis, fibrosis, calcium  channel dysregulation in cardiomyocytes, and increased interferon expression. NLE  incidence shows no sex difference, but there is a differential distribution of  clinical features across ethnic groups. The frequency of organ involvement in NLE  patients is more common in the cutaneous and cardiac. NLE also affects the  haematological and hepatobiliary systems, and some patients may experience  neurological and endocrinological involvement. Steroids and immunoglobulins can  aid in the recovery of some patients. Proper use of antimalarials during prenatal  and gestational periods may prevent or improve the prognosis of patients with  congenital heart block (CHB). Implantation of a pacemaker is effective in  maintaining cardiac function in children with complete atrioventricular block.  Symptoms associated with NLE may improve with antibody depletion, but some  patients may experience sequelae such as irreversible CHB, neuropsychiatric  disorders and developmental delays. Universal screening for autoantibodies to  Sjogren syndrome A or B autoantigens should be offered to women of childbearing  age experiencing desiccation syndrome. Antibody-positive individuals require  appropriate reproductive counselling and advice, along with close foetal  monitoring starting at 16 weeks of gestation and postnatal prognostic follow-up.  CONCLUSION: Epidemiologic investigations and clinical studies on NLE are  currently inadequate, and large-scale epidemiologic investigations, prospective  clinical studies, and basic research are needed in the future to improve the  understanding of the disease and the standardization of its clinical management.

T1  - Surgical outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome 
SP  - 62-72
AB  - BackgroundAntiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus are  autoimmune inflammatory conditions involving multiple organs and sharing various  clinical aspects. Owing to the scarcity of data about the surgical outcomes of  these autoimmune disorders, we conducted a systematic review to assess the  outcomes for patients with these diagnoses undergoing heart surgery and  contextualize the findings regarding high-risk cardiac surgeries.MethodsA  thorough search of PubMed, Embase and Scopus used Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standards to find articles that involved  patients who underwent heart surgery and had antiphospholipid syndrome and  systemic lupus erythematosus. Inclusion criteria concentrated on a definitive  diagnosis, while case reports and studies lacking data on surgical outcomes were  excluded. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodologies, quality evaluation  categorized studies according to their risk of bias.ResultsFourteen studies with  277 patients and a prevalence of middle-aged females met the inclusion criteria  out of 6381 papers. The major preoperative comorbidity in the cohort was a  history of thromboembolic events (43%). Thromboembolic complications (6%) and  catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (2%), even with appropriate  anticoagulation, were notable early post-operative outcomes. Six percent of  people died within 30 days. Data from follow-up studies showed a 14% death rate  and a 23% frequency of thromboembolic events.ConclusionsWith the striking  exception of a high frequency of thromboembolic complications and catastrophic  antiphospholipid syndrome, surgical results in patients with antiphospholipid  syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus are analogous to those in high-risk  cardiac procedures. Improving surgical care for this susceptible population  requires an understanding of these hazards.

AB  - Objective: Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are an established treatment in  several immune-mediated diseases such as dermatomyositis or Kawasaki disease and  they have been used in distinct clinical scenarios in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). However, in this latter disease no clear evidence besides  hematological or renal involvement supports its use. The aim of the present study  is to establish evidence for the treatment of non-renal non-hematological lupus  with IVIG.Methods: We have carried out a systematic literature review following  PRYSMA principles on the use of this treatment in SLE patients with no renal no  hematologic manifestations.Results: We found 35 articles which were split into  two subtypes, those with individualized data (29) and those with grouped data.  Overall, 198 lupus patients treated with IVIGs [178 (90%) women and 20 (10%) men]  were included. In 167 (84.3%) a clinical response was obtained [62 (31.3%)  complete and 105 (53%) a partial one]. Adverse events were reported in 40  patients (20.2%), most of them mild with only 2 (1%) severe. According to  individualized data, all cases with respiratory problems (5), 82.4% of those with  cardiac involvement (18) and 53.8% of those with neuropsychiatric manifestations  (18) achieved a complete response as more outstanding results.Conclusions: After  reviewing the experience of the use of IVIGs in extra-renal and extra-hematologic  SLE patients, this treatment is demonstrated to be useful in refractory cases,  especially in pulmonary, cardiac or neuropsychiatric complications with a good  safety profile.

T1  - Urine Protein Tests in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: What Do They Mean?
SP  - 308-315
AB  - The development of lupus nephritis (LN) in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Proteinuria  is a key indicator of kidney involvement; detecting and monitoring proteinuria is  therefore crucial as it acts as a surrogate marker for disease activity and has  significant prognostic value. This review explores the general mechanisms of  proteinuria and highlights the limitations of current measurement techniques. In  the absence of specific urinary markers for LN disease activity, evaluating  proteinuria involves considering its trajectory, amplitude of change, and the  overall clinical status of the patient. Differentiating between acute disease vs  proteinuria that may stem from scarring and glomerular basement membrane  remodeling can be challenging. Additionally, in the absence of other signs of  active disease, the time to recovery and resolution of proteinuria may be  prolonged.

T1  - Comparative efficacy and safety of different recommended doses of telitacicept in 
SP  - 1472292
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telitacicept, a new biological agent, was approved in China for  treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2021. Its optimal dosing for  treating SLE remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis is to  evaluate the efficacy and safety of various telitacicept doses in SLE treatment.  METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane libraries, Web of science, China National  Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang, and Sinomed were searched for the  controlled trials that studied the efficacy and safety of telitacicept on SLE  patients from their initiation to April 30, 2024. The analysis included three  randomized controlled trials (RCT) with 606 participants. We used fixed-effects  models for meta-analyses and the risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95%  confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety.  Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified using I(2). RESULTS: All telitacicept  dosages (80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg) significantly improved SLE Responder Index 4  (SRI4) responses compared to the control group (RR = 2.20, 95%CI:1.50-3.21, p <  0.0001; RR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.82-2.62, p < 0.00001; RR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.67-3.56, p  < 0.00001, respectively). The 80 mg, 160 mg, and 240 mg groups also showed better  improvement on SELENA-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) scores (RR =  1.63, 95%CI: 1.23-2.17, p = 0.0008; RR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.45-2.04, p < 0.00001; RR  = 1.73, 95%CI: 1.30-2.30, p = 0.0002, respectively) and Physician Global  Assessment (PGA) scores (RR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.09-1.44, p = 0.002; RR = 1.39,  95%CI: 1.25-1.55, p < 0.00001; RR = 1.24, 95%CI: 1.09-1.42, p = 0.002,  respectively). Furthermore, 160 mg group exhibited higher British Isles Lupus  Assessment Group (BILAG) score than the control group (RR = 1.11, 95%CI:  1.01-1.22, p = 0.03). As for security, 160 mg telitacicept group had higher  incidence of adverse events (AEs) than the control group (RR = 1.10, 95%CI:  1.03-1.18, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Telitacicept combined with standard therapy  presents potential benefits but there are certain safety concerns with certain  dosages of telitacicept, warranting further investigation for optimal dosing  strategies in SLE management.

T1  - Maternal and fetal outcomes in Latin American SLE pregnancies: A systematic 
SP  - 103744
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects women,  especially during their reproductive years, leading to increased risks during  pregnancy. Latina women develop SLE at a younger age, which increases their  susceptibility to pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth  and fetal growth restriction. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to  systematically review maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnant Latina women with  SLE and to perform a meta-analysis to assess specific risks associated with the  disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review according to PRISMA  guidelines was performed (PubMed and SciELO), including studies on SLE and  pregnancy in Latin America through December 2022. Eligible studies included case  reports, cohort studies and clinical trials in pregnant women with SLE. The  meta-analysis focused on key outcomes, including pre-eclampsia and lupus  nephritis, with relative risk (RR) calculations. RESULTS: Forty-four studies with  2190 pregnancies were included. High rates of pre-eclampsia (11-52 %), preterm  delivery (18.6-70.8 %), and fetal loss were reported. A decades-long analysis of  pregnancy outcomes in SLE in Latin America shows increased research and improved  care, with fetal loss rates decreasing from 35 % (1980-1999) to lower  intrauterine (28 %) and neonatal (10 %) death rates in 2020-2023. Meta-analysis  showed that lupus nephritis almost doubled the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR = 1.89,  95 % CI:1.40-2.55) compared to women without nephritis. CONCLUSION: Latina women  with SLE are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly  pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery. Lupus nephritis and disease activity are  major risk factors, highlighting the need for tailored care and early  intervention to improve maternal and fetal outcomes in this population.

T1  - The 2024 APLAR Consensus on the Management of Lupus Nephritis.
SP  - e70021
AB  - The APLAR has published a set of recommendations on the management of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2021. The current consensus paper supplements and  updates specifically the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) according to two  rounds of Delphi exercise from members of the APLAR SLE special interest group,  invited nephrologists, histopathologists, and lupus nephritis patients. For  initial treatment of LN, we recommend a combination of glucocorticoids (GCs) with  cyclophosphamide (CYC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or the calcineurin  inhibitors (CNIs) as first-line options. An upfront combination of  immunosuppressive drugs and the biological agents may be considered in patients  at significant risk of disease progression and renal function deterioration.  Switching or "add-on" among different immunosuppressive agents, including  biological agents, may be considered for refractory disease.  Subsequent/maintenance therapy of LN should continue for at least 3 years to  reduce the risk of renal flares. Lower dose MMF and azathioprine are options, but  MMF maintenance should follow induction by the same drug. Prednisolone or  equivalent should be maintained at a dose of 5 mg/day or less. The APLAR  consensus for the management of LN includes recommendations for adjunctive  therapies, monitoring and treatment of LN-related co-morbidities, and renal  replacement therapies. It is hoped that this consensus paper can provide an  evidence-based and pragmatic approach to the management of LN, taking into  account the evidence level of therapies in Asian patients, cost-effectiveness,  and differences in health care resources and reimbursement policies in the  Asia-Pacific region.

T1  - Acute coronary syndromes in young lupus patients, shifting the view on the old 
SP  - 939-945
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of  coronary heart disease (CHD). Even though the absolute risk of cardiovascular  disease (CVD) among SLE patients increases with advancing age, younger female  patients are at the greatest risk of developing acute myocardial infarction  (AMI). These young patients are not considered to be at high risk for CVD using  traditional risk assessment tools. Also, subclinical atherosclerosis is less  common among young lupus patients. AMI could present with or without significant  obstruction in coronary arteries in younger patients. There are no guidelines on  appropriate cardiac screening of younger lupus patients, often without chest pain  or who present with non-specific complaints. In recent years, the incidence of  acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and ST-segment elevation AMI has decreased in the  general population and in older lupus patients. Why has a similar decline in  cardiovascular (CV) events not been seen in younger lupus patients? Since the  issue of CVD in younger lupus patients is under-researched, a narrative review,  rather than a systematic literature review was performed, based on the selected  articles and points of view relevant to the topic. The aim of this review is to  raise awareness of the relationship between SLE and CVD in younger ages, discuss  possible non-atherosclerotic mechanisms of obstructive and non-obstructive CHD in  lupus, elaborate on acute coronary syndromes unique for young patients, point out  current challenges in identifiing at-risk patients for ACS, potential for new  imaging techniques, the need for individualised treatment, with or without  coronary stenting in ACS, and to underscore the relevance of CVD studies in young  patients with SLE.

T1  - Optimal glucocorticoid therapy in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 1284-1293
AB  - This review provides an in-depth analysis of glucocorticoid therapy for lupus  nephritis (LN), a severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus that  affects up to 51.7% of patients. LN significantly increases the risk of mortality  and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Glucocorticoids have been central to  LN treatment for decades due to their anti-inflammatory properties, but optimal  dosing strategies remain uncertain. The review discusses the historical evolution  of glucocorticoid use, highlighting the shift from high-dose regimens to combined  approaches with immunosuppressants and lower glucocorticoid doses to minimize  adverse effects. Mechanistically, glucocorticoids exert effects through genomic  and non-genomic pathways, modulating immune responses and metabolism. Long-term  use is associated with risks such as infection, osteoporosis, hyperglycemia and  cardiovascular disease. The review examines different dosing strategies,  including intravenous pulse therapy and oral regimens, and presents evidence of  their efficacy and safety. It also explores alternative approaches, such as  low-dose and glucocorticoid-free regimens, which show promise but require further  study. The review concludes by emphasizing the need for future research to  optimize glucocorticoid regimens, refine tapering protocols and identify safer  therapeutic combinations, as glucocorticoids remain a cornerstone in LN  management despite their challenges.

T1  - Diagnostic and prognostic value of quantitative cardiac magnetic resonance 
SP  - 3858-3870
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare CMR imaging biomarkers between  SLE patients and matched controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases  were systematically searched from inception until November 2023. All studies  reporting CMR imaging data in SLE patients were included. PRISMA guidelines were  followed, and risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality  Assessment Scale. CMR findings of SLE patients were compared to that of matched  controls. Clinical features associated with CMR biomarkers were collected in a  qualitative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 64 studies were included in the  systematic review pooling 3304 individuals including 1870 SLE patients. Of these,  19 case-control studies were included in the comparative meta-analysis (1576  individuals, including 884 SLE patients). Compared to controls, left ventricular  (LV) ejection fraction (62% vs. 64%, p = 0.001) and indexed end-diastolic volume  (77 vs. 72 mL/m(2), p = 0.006) were significantly altered in SLE patients. Late  gadolinium enhancement (LGE) extent was higher in SLE patients (LGE mass/total LV  mass: 3.5% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.009). Native T1 and T2 relaxation times were  significantly higher in SLE patients (native T1 [1.5 T]: 1005 vs. 982 ms,  p = 0.02; native T1 [3 T]: 1267 vs. 1140 ms, p < 0.001; T2 [all fields]: 58 vs.  51 ms, p < 0.001). Three studies found an association between disease activity  and increased T2 relaxation times. Two studies identified an association between  clinical outcomes and CMR parameters. CONCLUSIONS: While CMR-assessed ventricular  function and volumes only slightly differed in SLE patients when compared to  controls, myocardial tissue characterization parameters were significantly  modified and associated with disease activity. KEY POINTS: Question What are the  diagnostic and prognostic values of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) quantitative  parameters in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients? Findings Myocardial  tissue characterization parameters are significantly altered in SLE patients and  associated with disease activity. Clinical relevance CMR imaging demonstrates  subclinical cardiac alterations in systemic lupus erythematosus patients.  Additional studies are required to further demonstrate the prognostic value of  CMR in SLE.

T1  - Deucravacitinib shows superior efficacy and safety in cutaneous lupus 
SP  - 103723
AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel therapies for cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) demonstrated efficacy and safety in previous trials.  However, data on the comparison of these treatments is still lacking, limiting  their integration into clinical practice. Therefore, our aim is to perform a  systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of  novel systemic therapies in CLE. METHODS: A systematic search was performed  across PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL on November 25, 2023, to identify studies  involving patients with CLE or SLE with active skin involvement treated with  novel systemic therapies. The primary outcomes assessed were the proportion of  patients achieving the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity  Index-50 (CLASI-50), the change in CLASI-A, the occurrence of adverse events  (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS: 18,280 records were retrieved,  of which 53 met the inclusion criteria. Deucravacitinib showed significantly  greater efficacy in achieving the CLASI50 compared to placebo (OR: 8.28, 95 % CI:  2.22-30.91). Both litifilimab (OR: 2.54, 95 % CI: 1.20-5.40) and anifrolumab (OR:  2.25, 95 % CI: 1.23-4.14) were also significantly more effective than placebo. No  significant differences were observed in the occurrence of AEs and SAEs between  these therapeutics and placebo. CONCLUSION: Anifrolumab and litifilimab are  effective and safe treatment options in CLE. However, deucravacitinib  demonstrated superior efficacy and safety with fewer adverse events compared to  anifrolumab. CLE patients who have shown an inadequate response to first- and  second-line treatments may benefit from the incorporation of deucravacitinib into  their treatment regimens.

T1  - Impact of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus on Conception: Insights into Infertility, 
SP  - 209-227
AB  - Many individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) face significant  challenges manifesting their family planning goals due to numerous factors,  including disease-related complications, treatment-induced effects, immunological  factors, self-imposed limitations, and the socioeconomic impacts of having a  chronic disease. Instances of unexplained infertility are also prevalent.  Encouragingly, advancements in treatment modalities, risk factor management,  specialized training within the medical community, and enhanced patient/provider  education have contributed to an increase in successful pregnancies among SLE  patients, fostering a safer, more promising reproductive landscape. However,  despite advances, individuals with SLE continue to struggle with the complexities  of family building. This review explores infertility and pregnancy outcomes in  SLE, fertility preservation, the role of assisted reproductive technology, and  considerations for tailoring these approaches to SLE patients.

T1  - The importance of developing reproducible primary endpoints for clinical trials 
SP  - 183-192
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current usage of reproducible primary endpoints and  tools for assessing treatment response for clinical trials for systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), and emphasize the need for developing standardized,  reproducible endpoints in this context. METHOD: A comprehensive review of Phase  II and III SLE biologic trials from the past 15 years was conducted using PubMed  and ClinicalTrials.gov. The analysis focused on clinical trial endpoints, disease  activity indices, and the evolution of primary endpoints. Key measurement tools,  including the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-Based Composite Lupus  Assessment (BICLA), the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI), and  the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure-Revised (SLAM-R), were examined. RESULTS: The  SRI emerged as the most commonly used composite measure for phase II/III clinical  trial endpoints, with over 60% of ongoing trials employing SRI (4) as the primary  endpoint. BICLA, derived from the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)  index, was also frequently used but demonstrated notable differences from SRI in  its approach. Our analysis underscores the ongoing need for more effective tools  to assess disease activity and treatment response in SLE trials. CONCLUSIONS: The  selection of optimal primary endpoints is vital for SLE clinical trials due to  the disease's heterogeneity and the variability in treatment responses.  Currently, different primary endpoints are employed depending on the specific  focus of clinical trials. While the SRI is widely used in phase II/III trials,  the standardized efficacy measures are critical to enhancing the design and  outcomes of future SLE clinical trials. Key points * Selecting optimal primary  endpoints is crucial for SLE clinical trials. * Challenges in SLE treatment  response assessment include patient heterogeneity and inconsistent disease  activity evaluation. * BICLA and SRI are commonly used as primary endpoints but  have notable differences. * There is an urgent need for better tools to assess  disease activity and response in SLE clinical trials.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with lupus nephritis: A systematic 
SP  - 53-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of  rituximab (RTX) in patients with lupus nephritis (LN). MATERIALS AND METHODS:  PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Cochrane Library,  and Wanfang Databases were searched to collect literature on the efficacy and  safety of RTX in patients with LN. Odds ratios (ORs), weighted mean differences  (WMDs), and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used to represent treatment  efficacy and overall outcome. The outcomes included complete renal remission  rate, proteinuria, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)  scores, serum creatinine, any adverse events and serious adverse events. We  explored the heterogeneity with I(2) and assessed publication bias with funnel  plot and Egger's test. RESULTS: Nine studies involving 723 patients (254 in the  RTX group and 469 in the control group) were included in our systematic review  and meta-analysis. RTX resulted in a higher complete renal remission rate (OR:  2.62; 95% CI 1.43 - 4.79, p = 0.024, I(2) = 54.7%) than the control group. It  significantly decreased SLEDAI scores (WMD = -3.79, 95% CI: -5.78 to -1.8,  p < 0.001, I(2) = 94.7%) as well as proteinuria (WMD = -0.9, 95% CI: -1.6 to  -0.2, p < 0.001, I(2) = 97.6%). There were no significant differences in any  adverse events and serious adverse events between the RTX group and control  group. CONCLUSION: RTX was an effective therapeutic agent in patients with LN,  and it did not increase the risk of adverse events compared to the control group.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: redefining the treatment goals.
SP  - 198-211
AB  - The course of proliferative lupus nephritis is characterized by flares of  activity alternating with periods of quiescence against a background of chronic  immune dysregulation. An accurate assessment of disease activity is of  unassailable importance to tailor therapy. In the present communication, we  discuss the available clinical, serologic, and histologic tools to evaluate  disease activity and how they may be applied to redefine the treatment goals in  lupus nephritis. Traditionally, treatment response is judged by the degree of  proteinuria reduction and improvement of kidney function, but this fails to  differentiate ongoing inflammatory disease from chronic damage. Despite intensive  research, no novel biomarker has proved useful for clinical practice, and we  continue to rely on anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels to assess serologic  activity. Repeat kidney biopsies sometimes reveal persistent inflammation despite  apparent clinical remission, giving credibility to the conviction that histologic  remission should be a treatment goal and protocol biopsies be part of the  decision-making process. However, the discrepancies between clinical and  histologic responses to therapy can be explained by persistent systemic  autoimmunity with low-grade immune complex deposition or, alternatively, by  delayed clearance of intrarenal inflammation once immunologic remission has been  achieved. Because persistent immune dysregulation is the motor of disease  activity in lupus nephritis, it should be the principal focus of therapy and  monitoring. We propose to replace the traditional induction-remission maintenance  protocol by a more dynamic and individualized approach and aim for 3 treatment  goals, concomitantly rather than sequentially: (i) clinical remission, by  attenuating renal inflammation, using microscopic hematuria, proteinuria,  estimated glomerular filtration rate, and complement levels as biomarkers; (ii)  immunologic remission, by decreasing immune complex generation, using  anti-double-stranded DNA antibody as a biomarker; and (iii) preservation of  kidney function, by curtailing chronic kidney damage, using estimated glomerular  filtration rate slope as a biomarker.

T1  - Effect of hydroxychloroquine on pregnancy outcome in patients with SLE: a 
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an antimalarial drug employed in the  treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prior studies reported  inconsistent results regarding the association between HCQ use during pregnancy  and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of HCQ on  pregnancy-related outcomes in women with SLE. METHODS: We conducted a systematic  search for studies associating pregnancy outcomes with HCQ use in PubMed, EMBASE,  Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang database and VIP from inception  to 22 September 2022. Random or fixed effect models were used to estimate the  pooled effect based on I(2) measurement of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty-one  studies were included, encompassing 929 and 1031 patients in HCQ and non-HCQ  groups, respectively. We found that HCQ use was significantly associated with  reduced risks of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)  scores (second trimester: mean difference (MD) -1.80, 95% CI -2.46 to -1.13;  third trimester: MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.31 to -1.29), flare (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to  0.97), preterm birth (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.72), intrauterine growth  retardation (IUGR) (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72), gestational hypertension (OR  0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.42), pre-eclampsia (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.72). In  contrast, a positive correlation was observed between full-term birth and HCQ use  (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.65). However, the result for disease flare exhibited  high heterogeneity (p=0.01, I(2)=59%). In addition, publication bias was detected  in the meta-analysis of full-term birth using the Egger's test. CONCLUSIONS: This  meta-analysis offers a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between  disease activity, pregnancy-related outcomes and HCQ use, providing supportive  evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of HCQ in pregnant women with SLE.

AB  - SLE is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease that affects the kidneys in  approximately 50% of patients, with the prevalence rising to as high as 70% in  certain populations, such as African American and Asian people. Antimalarials-and  particularly hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-are currently considered a mainstay of  therapy, together with immunosuppressants. Over the past decades, several studies  have extensively investigated the mechanisms of action of antimalarial agents and  their potential beneficial properties in patients with SLE in general. However,  the evidence for the therapeutic benefit of HCQ in patients with lupus nephritis  (LN) derives mainly from observational studies, conducted in an era before the  refinement of induction and maintenance protocols for immunosuppressive therapy.  Despite the paucity of high-quality evidence on its efficacy in LN, the  nephrology community widely supports the universal use of HCQ in patients with  LN, and recommendations for its use are firmly entrenched in various clinical  practice guidelines. Nonetheless, the use of antimalarials may also carry  inherent risks, underscoring the importance of personalized approaches in these  patients. Herein, we comprehensively review the available literature on  antimalarials in LN, aiming to update the current evidence, limitations, and  future perspectives for the use of antimalarials in adults.

T1  - Effectiveness and safety of B cell-targeting biologics in the treatment of lupus 
SP  - 2416605
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different B  cell-targeting biological agents combining with standard of care in patients with  lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted  using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Central in the Cochran Library,  spanning from inception to May 20th, 2024. Randomized control trials (RCTs)  comparing rituximab (RTX), belimumab, ocrelizumab, obinutuzumab, and anifrolumab  in LN were selected. The primary outcomes of interest were related to complete  renal remission (CRR), and partial renal remission (PRR). Additionally, we delved  into safety outcomes, examining the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs),  infections, and the discontinuation rates due to adverse events. RESULTS: A total  of 6 RCTs with 1150 patients applying various B cell-targeting biological agents  were included. Notably, ranking probability based on the surface under the  cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that obinutuzumab (SUCRA 85.2%) has  the highest potential superiority in improving CRR, followed by belimumab,  ocrelizumab. Regarding the improvement in PRR, obinutuzumab (SUCRA 83.0%) has the  highest potential superiority. In terms of safety, with a focus on SAEs,  infections, and the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, the results  were: SUCRA-based ranking indicated that RTX (SUCRA 74.1%) had the highest  probability of postponing SAEs, followed by belimumab and obinutuzumab.  Concerning infection reduction, anifrolumab (SUCRA 78.7%) had the highest  potential superiority. Safety events monitoring infection occurred better with  RTX than with standard therapy (OR = 3.57, 95% CI 1.02, 12.66) and were  statistically different. For the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, RTX  (SUCRA 88.6%) demonstrated the highest potential superiority. CONCLUSIONS:  Concerning the effectiveness and safety outcomes, obinutuzumab, belimumab, and  RTX plus standard of care may be superior to the current standard therapy as  treatments for LN. This study protocol has been registered with PROSPERO, with a  registration number of CRD42024548522.

T1  - Lupus activity and pregnancy outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus patients 
SP  - 33-41
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease primarily  impacting women of childbearing age. While pregnancy and hormonal stress can  trigger SLE flare-ups, the effects of assisted reproductive therapies (ARTs) on  SLE patients are not well defined. We conducted a search of PubMed/Medline,  Embase, and CENTRAL until March 20, 2024, to find observational studies assessing  the prevalence of SLE flares and pregnancy outcomes following ARTs. Our analysis  included random-effects meta-analysis and the Grading of Recommendations  Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for evaluating evidence  quality. Five studies involving 237 SLE women who underwent ARTs were eligible.  The meta-analysis indicated a prevalence of SLE flares at 17% (95% CI: 10-25%)  with moderate-quality evidence. The pooled prevalence of arthritis flares was 7%  (95% CI: 0-25%) with low-quality evidence. Successful pregnancy rates were 58%  (95% CI: 43-72%), and live birth rates were 96% (95% CI: 83-100%), both with  low-quality evidence. Moderate-quality evidence showed pregnancy complications,  including preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) at 8% (95% CI: 3-16%),  miscarriages at 2% (95% CI: 0-9%), intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) at 4% (95%  CI: 0-11%), and preeclampsia at 7% (95% CI: 1-17%). Low-quality evidence showed  preterm labor at 10% (95% CI: 0-32%) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)  at 2% (95% CI: 0-11%). SLE flares, as well as pregnancy complications such as  IUFD, miscarriage, PPROM, and preeclampsia in ART recipients, are equivalent to  those in spontaneous conception. This indicates that ART is relatively safe for  SLE patients with meticulous pregnancy planning. Key Points * Systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease primarily impacting women of  childbearing age. * Pregnancy in women with SLE poses elevated maternal and fetal  risks compared to healthy women. * SLE flares and pregnancy complications while  receiving ART are equivalent to those in spontaneous conception and ART is  relatively safe for SLE patients.

T1  - Immune-mediating and immunosuppressive pharmacotherapies for proliferative lupus 
SP  - 2061-2076
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Proliferative lupus nephritis is a common and severe complication  of systemic lupus erythematosus. Affected patients are at an increased risk of  developing chronic kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and extra-renal  comorbidities. In recent years, the prognosis for patients with proliferative  lupus nephritis has improved thanks to advancements in management regimens.  Despite these advances, lupus nephritis continues to present therapeutic  complexities and unmet needs. AREAS COVERED: Research was conducted across major  databases to identify the most relevant articles pertaining to immune-mediating  and immunosuppressive therapies in lupus nephritis. EXPERT OPINION: The prognosis  for patients with proliferative lupus nephritis remains severe. Some drugs used  in this disease may be unable to control activity, and most of them have a low  therapeutic index and may cause severe and life-threatening side effects.  Nonetheless, better management of traditional drugs and the introduction of novel  therapies have improved renal prognosis and reduced local and systemic adverse  events in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.

T1  - Efficacy of psychological interventions to reduce anxiety and depression in 
SP  - 440-451
AB  - The presence of anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with lupus is common,  and some research reports that psychological interventions can reduce them,  therefore we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of  psychological interventions in adults with systemic lupus erythematosus.  Randomized and non-randomized clinical trials with adult population diagnosed  with lupus, treated with psychological intervention, and compared with similar  groups were selected. Several databases were searched in July 2023. Fourteen  studies were included in the meta-analysis, with moderate effect sizes for  anxiety and depression in group intervention modalities. Factors such as  percentage of sample with lupus, gender, medication, and interventions with  relaxation components influenced the results. Group psychological intervention  programs are effective in reducing symptoms in patients with lupus, although  further research on treatment modulating variables is needed.

T1  - Redefining kidney transplantation procedure among adult lupus nephritis: 
SP  - 12627
AB  - BACKGROUND: The actual prognostic impact of prior lupus nephritis (LN) diagnosis  on end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients remains questionable, especially in  relation to outcomes of kidney transplantation (KTx) We aim to determine the  survival of the graft and recipient after the KTx procedure among patients with  ESKD due to LN in comparison to non-LN. METHODS: This meta-analysis included  retrospective studies from the last two decades, focusing on the KTx's outcomes  among ESKD due to LN in comparison to non-LN. We establish the graft/recipient  survival rate at different follow-up intervals as the primary outcome, and acute  graft rejection and pooled graft failure rate as secondary outcomes. All analyses  were performed with the random-effect model (REM) and were presented as odd ratio  (OR; within 95% confidence interval (CI)). The protocol of this study was  registered in PROSPERO: CRD42023394310. RESULTS: A total of 1,299 KTx (368 LN  patients) from 10 studies with >10 years of follow-up were thoroughly reviewed.  All checkpoints (at 1-, 5-, 10, and 15-year post-KTx) on graft survival rate  demonstrated comparable outcomes in either LN or non-LN (e.g., at 10-year follow  up (OR, 1.08 [0.40, 2.91]; p = 0.88). Similar findings at all checkpoints for  recipient survival rate were also observed without statistically significant  difference between LN and non-LN arm (e.g., at 10-year checkpoint; OR, 0.99  [0.68, 1.46]; p = 0.98). Both of our secondary analyses also presented  insignificant differences (p = 0.70 and = 0.16, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our  findings suggested that prognosis of ESKD due to complicated LN is equal compared  to ESKD associated with non-LN etiologies, suggesting the impact of LN as the  inducing cause of ESKD on KTx outcome is relatively neglectable.

T1  - Biologicals for the treatment of lupus nephritis: a Bayesian network 
SP  - 1445814
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies comparing the efficacy and safety of different  treatment regimens for lupus nephritis are scarce. Moreover, confounding factors  such as the duration of follow-up were hardly adjusted in those studies,  potentially compromising the results and their extents to clinical settings.  OBJECTIVE: To rigorously investigate the efficacy and safety of biologics in  patients with lupus nephritis using Bayesian network meta-regression analyses  that adjust for the follow-up period, in order to provide more robust evidence  for clinicians. METHODS: Databases comprising PubMed, Embase, MedlinePlus,  Cochrane Library, Google Scholars, and Scopus were retrieved for eligible  articles from inception to February 29, 2024. The primary endpoint was the  complete response rate, the secondary endpoint was the partial response rate, the  tertiary endpoints were the adverse events, and infection-related adverse events.  Napierian Logarithm of hazard ratio (lnHR) and the standard error of lnHR  (selnHR) were generated for dichotomous variants by STATA 18.0 MP and then put  into Rstudio 4.3.2 to conduct Bayesian network meta-analysis as well as network  meta-regression analysis to yield hazard ratio (HR) as pairwise effect size.  RESULTS: Ten studies involving 2138 patients and 11 treatment regimens were  ultimately included. In the original analysis, for the primary endpoint, compared  to the control group, obinutuzumab (22.6 months), abatacept-30mg (20.5 months),  abatacept-10mg (17.8 months), and belimumab (23.3 months) demonstrated  significant superiority (HR ranged from 1.6 to 2.5), more ever, their  significance regarding relative efficacy was correlated with follow up period,  namely "time window" (shown in parentheses above). For the secondary endpoint,  compared to the control group, obinutuzumab and abatacept-30mg showed conspicuous  preponderance (HR ranged from 1.6 to 2.4), "time window" was also detected in  abatacept-30mg (20.5 months), whereas obinutuzumab remained consistently  obviously effective regardless of the follow-up period (shown in parentheses  above). For the tertiary endpoint, there were no differences among active  regimens and control. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the efficacy and safety and "time  window" phenomenon, we recommend obinutuzumab as the preferred treatment for LN.  Certainly, more rigorous head-to-head clinical trials are warranted to validate  those findings.

T1  - Obesity as an aggravating factor of systemic lupus erythematosus disease: What we 
SP  - 112559
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can  affect various organs and systems. Symptoms of SLE can vary widely from person to  person and over time, including fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, fever, and  inflammation of multiple organs. The association between SLE and excess body  weight has been the subject of study, with evidence suggesting that overweight  and obesity can worsen the disease s clinical presentation. Obesity is linked to  a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, which can exacerbate the inflammation  present in SLE. Additionally, obesity may negatively impact treatment response,  disease progression, and patient prognosis. Patients with SLE and obesity may  face additional challenges in managing the disease, such as increased symptom  severity, higher risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, and a reduced  response to conventional treatments. Obesity can also influence the quality of  life of patients with SLE, making a holistic approach that considers the  individual's nutritional status essential. Therefore, understanding the  relationship between obesity and SLE is crucial for optimizing treatment,  improving clinical outcomes, and enhancing patients' quality of life. Further  research is needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms,  develop more precise and personalized management strategies, and identify  biomarkers that can predict disease prognosis and treatment response.

SP  - 2395451
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of biologics,  multitarget therapy, and standard therapy for the induction of lupus nephritis.  METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases (EMBASE, Web of Science,  PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov) was conducted from inception to  30 August 2023. Our study included randomized controlled trials enrolling adult  lupus nephritis patients treated with biologics or multitarget therapy, in  comparison with standard therapy. The primary outcomes were the rates of complete  renal remission (CRR) and serious adverse events (SAE). Stata 15.0 was used to  conduct the network meta-analysis. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials with  a total of 1989 patients met the inclusion criteria. The network meta-analysis  indicated that compared with standard therapy, multitarget therapy, obinutuzumab,  belimumab, and voclosporin therapy demonstrated superior efficacy in achieving  complete renal remission. Among these options, multitarget therapy had the  greatest effect (OR = 2.78, 95% CI = 1.81-4.26). Regarding safety, it was  observed that there were no significant statistical differences among the various  treatment options. Cluster analysis revealed that both obinutuzumab and belimumab  exhibited good efficacy and safety. CONCLUSIONS: belimumab and obinutuzumab stood  out as promising treatments due to their good performance in terms of efficacy  and safety. Multitarget therapy may be the most effective approach for treating  lupus nephritis. However, since the study population consists exclusively of  Asian patients, further research is needed to verify the efficacy of multitarget  therapy in lupus nephritis patients of non-Asian descent.

T1  - Echocardiography in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 1265-1271
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  cardiovascular involvement is common and a major cause of morbidity and  mortality. There have been few recent updates regarding the cardiac involvement  in this clinical entity. The purpose of the review is to provide an update on the  role of echocardiography in the management of these patients. RECENT FINDINGS:  Echocardiography remains the imaging modality of choice and should be considered  even in asymptomatic patients with SLE to detect cardiac abnormalities which are  frequently not clinically apparent. Transesophageal echocardiography has higher  sensitivity and specificity in identifying valvular lesions, and should be  utilized in high risk patients when transthoracic echocardiography is negative.  New advances such as speckle tracking echocardiography has shown promise in the  detection of occult myocardial dysfunction, but more studies are needed to have a  proper perspective of its role in SLE patients. SLE has protean cardiac  manifestations. The most common involvement is pericarditis. Complicated  pericarditis such as tamponade and constriction are rare but should be considered  if the symptoms do not subside with treatment. Valvular involvement can take  several forms. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is the most common form and is more  prevalent in patients with high disease activity and with the presence of  antisphopholipid antibodies. Myocardial involvement portends poor prognosis and  should be sought and treated promptly to prevent morbidity and mortality.

T1  - Pregnancy outcome predictors in systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review 
SP  - e667-e683
AB  - BACKGROUND: To enhance patient-tailored preconception risk assessment for women  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), knowledge on risk factors associated  with adverse pregnancy outcomes is required. Therefore, we did a systematic  review and meta-analysis to identify and provide unambiguous effect sizes of  preconception predictors of pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE. METHODS: In  this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed and Embase for  studies reporting preconception predictors of pregnancy outcomes in women with  SLE, from database inception to Aug 22, 2023. Studies were included if they  presented original, quantitative data on pregnant women with SLE and reported on  preconception risk factors on at least one of the outcomes as defined in the  protocol. Studies were excluded if they had a sample size of less than 20  patients, were restricted to multiple pregnancies, had unclear timing of  prognostication, or exclusively reported a composite outcome. Literature  screening, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment (quality in prognostic  studies tool) were done by two reviewers independently, in a blinded,  standardised manner. The reported outcomes included livebirth, pre-eclampsia,  small for gestational age, preterm birth, pregnancy loss before and after 20  weeks of gestation, and SLE flares. We computed pooled univariate odds ratios  (ORs) and 95% CIs using a random effects model. We assessed heterogeneity using  the I(2) statistic and prediction intervals. This study is registered with  PROSPERO, CRD42022344732. FINDINGS: Of the 6705 unique articles identified, 72  (1.1%) were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 10 355 pregnancies in 8065  women with SLE. One potentially eligible study was retracted and therefore  removed from our analysis. Previous lupus nephritis was associated with decreased  livebirth probability (OR 0.62 [95% CI 0.47-0.81]; I(2)=0%), increased risk of  preterm birth (2.00 [1.55-2.57]; I(2)=17%), and increased risk of pre-eclampsia  (3.11 [2.35-4.12]; I(2)=0%). Chronic hypertension was associated with increased  risk of disease flare (2.50 [1.74-3.58]; I(2)=0%), preterm birth (2.65  [1.87-3.77]; I(2)=0%), and pre-eclampsia (5.86 [3.41-10.06]; I(2)=33%). SLE  disease activity at conception or preconception was associated with increased  risk of preterm birth (2.91 [1.96-4.33]; I(2)=21%) and pre-eclampsia (2.32  [1.40-3.83]; I(2)=0%). Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome was associated with  decreased livebirth probability (0.40 [0.27-0.58]; I(2)=0%), increased risk of  pregnancy loss after 20 weeks of gestation (2.77 [1.44-5.31]; I(2)=0%), and  increased risk of preterm birth (1.65 [1.29-2.11]; I(2)=0%). Across studies,  risk-of-bias assessment suggested considerable bias in study attrition and  confounding. INTERPRETATION: We identified previous lupus nephritis, chronic  hypertension, SLE disease activity before and at conception, and secondary  antiphospholipid syndrome as predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women  with SLE. These findings contribute to an optimal patient-tailored risk  assessment in preconception counselling. FUNDING: None.

SP  - e1364
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve our understanding of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE)-macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). METHODS: A systematic review was  performed, to retrieve all those papers on patients with SLE-MAS, in individual  or aggregated form. The data in each of these medical records were extracted and  analyzed to identify the characteristics of SLE-MAS. RESULTS: A total of 86  SLE-MAS patients were included (25 males and 61 females. The mean (+/-standard  error of the mean) age was 31.21 +/- 1.694 years. MAS occurred as the initial  presentation of SLE in 47 people (54.65%) and during the course of SLE in 39  (45.35%). A coinfection was reported in 23 (26.74%) patients. The mean Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score was 16.54 +/- 0.9462.  Overall, 10 patients (11.63%) died. The SLEDAI-2K score was higher in patients  with MAS as an initial manifestation of SLE than in those where MAS occurred  during the course of SLE. The proportion of patients receiving steroid pulse  therapy was lower in patients with coinfections. The deceased group demonstrated  lower platelet and ferritin levels. Multiple regression analysis revealed that  age and thrombocytopenia were independent factors associated with poor prognosis.  In receiver operating characteristic analysis, a platelet count cutoff value of  </=47 x 10(9)/L was a predictor of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: SLE-MAS patients  demonstrated high lupus activity, and lupus activity was especially higher in  patients with MAS as an initial manifestation. Lupus activity was the predominant  trigger of lupus MAS. Thrombocytopenia was an independent factor for poor  prognosis.

T1  - [Lupus nephritis and thrombotic microangiopathy: A review].
SP  - 628-634
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most common organ-specific manifestations of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Various clinical signs of LN develop in at  least 50% of patients with SLE. In addition to LN, the spectrum of renal lesions  associated with SLE also includes vascular pathology. One of the variants of  renal microvascular injury is thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the mechanisms of  which are diverse. The review focuses on the main forms of TMA, including  antiphospholipid syndrome and nephropathy associated with antiphospholipid  syndrome, TMA caused by complement system regulation disorders and deficiency of  ADAMTS13. In most cases, these forms of TMA are combined with LN. However, they  may also exist as a single form of kidney damage. This article discusses the TMA  pathogenesis, the impact on kidney prognosis, and treatment options.

SP  - 758-762
AB  - Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) nephropathy is an autoimmune disease that is  sometimes accompanied by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we report the  use of rituximab to treat a case of APS nephropathy in a SLE patient with  recurrent vascular thrombosis. A 52-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with  SLE 11 years earlier, was referred to a nephrology clinic for evaluation of  azotaemia and proteinuria. She had experienced spontaneous abortion at 35 years  of age. The patient had been diagnosed with right popliteal thrombosis at  39 years of age, and with left pulmonary artery thrombosis and SLE at 41 years of  age. Before admission, she was undergoing anticoagulant and immunosuppressive  therapies, with follow-up in the rheumatology clinic. At her last outpatient  clinic visit before admission, she exhibited mild bilateral lower-limb pitting  oedema, impaired renal function and proteinuria. Renal biopsy revealed arteriolar  wall thickening, with thrombi in the capillary lumina and marked inflammatory  cell infiltration in the interstitium. The patient was treated with warfarin and  high-dose corticosteroids. Intravenous rituximab (500 mg) was also administered  twice at a 4-week interval. Her renal function did not worsen any further, and  her proteinuria decreased. Here we report the successful use of rituximab to  treat APS nephropathy in a patient with SLE, who had progressive renal  insufficiency.

SP  - 439-446
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with variable  clinical presentation and organ involvement. Early diagnosis and rapid  achievement of low disease activity or remission reduces organ damage and  improves prognosis. Therapeutic principles can be divided into so-called basic  measures and immunosuppressive treatment. Novel drugs have been developed in  recent years, with new classes of agents being added for the treatment of SLE.  These include biologic therapies and approved therapeutic options for the  treatment of lupus nephritis. In light of improved treatment options, good  disease control can now frequently be achieved; with savings on glucocorticoids,  combination therapies are increasingly being used. Of great importance is the  consistent use of basic measures, which include the use of hydroxychloroquine,  optimization of cardiovascular risk factors, UV protection, bone-protective  measures, and the implementation of vaccinations. In the treatment of lupus  nephritis, conservative therapeutic measures for nephroprotection play a crucial  role in renal prognosis. Finally, non-pharmacological therapy options such as  exercise therapy are of great importance for improving quality of life.

AB  - The 2023 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) faced several tasks: the newly approved medications  anifrolumab and voclosporin as well as the additional approval of belimumab for  lupus nephritis had to be conceptionally fitted into the management of SLE. Novel  data on hydroxychloroquine and glucocorticoids, additional results for the  treat-to-target goals remission and low disease activity and experience with  respect to vaccinations and infections had to be considered. Additionally, EULAR  specified a slightly modified structure. The update was further developed with  5 overarching principles and 13 recommendations. An SLE activity score is  required for each patient visit. All SLE patients should receive  hydroxychloroquine at a target dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. Glucocorticoids  should only be used if necessary and reduced to not more than 5 mg prednisone  equivalent daily in the long-term or, even better, tapered off. If the target of  remission or low disease activity is not reached, methotrexate, azathioprine,  mycophenolate and/or belimumab or anifrolumab should be used. For lupus  nephritis, Euro-Lupus cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate are options for induction  therapy and mycophenolate or azathioprine for maintenance. In the case of severe  nephritis, the addition of belimumab or a calcineurin inhibitor (voclosporin or  tacrolimus) should be considered. It is important that treatment should be  continued for at least 3 years. This review article describes the details of the  new recommendations against the background of relevant studies in recent years  and classifies them in the clinical context.

T1  - Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine-Induced Cardiac Arrhythmias and Sudden Cardiac 
SP  - 158-169
AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) are foundational treatments for  several systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Concerns regarding the risk of  cardiac arrhythmia and death have been raised, yet the burden of HCQ and  CQ-related cardiac toxicities remains unclear. A systematic literature search was  conducted in the MEDLINE and Embase databases for articles published between the  earliest date and April 2023 reporting cardiac conduction abnormalities in  patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases taking HCQ or CQ.  Meta-analysis was performed to calculate the difference in mean corrected QT  (QTc) interval and odds ratio of prolonged QTc interval in those taking HCQ or CQ  versus not. Of 2673 unique records, 34 met the inclusion criteria, including  70,609 subjects. Thirty-three studies reported outcomes in HCQ and 9 in CQ. Five  studies reported outcomes in RA, 11 in SLE, and 18 in populations with mixed  rheumatic diseases. Eleven studies reported mean QTc and OR for prolonged QTc for  meta-analysis, all reporting outcomes in HCQ. There was a significant increase in  mean QTc (10.29 ms,  P  = 0.458) among HCQ users compared to non-HCQ users in  patients with RA. There was no difference in mean QTc between HCQ and non-HCQ  users in other systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. When rheumatic diseases  were pooled, HCQ users were more likely to have prolonged QTc compared to non-HCQ  users (odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI, 1.19, 2.08). The results of this study suggest  that clinicians should be aware of potential adverse cardiac events of HCQ and  consider QTc monitoring for patients on HCQ for the treatment of systemic  autoimmune rheumatic diseases.

T1  - Impact of Glucocorticoid Dose on Complete Response, Serious Infections, and 
SP  - 1408-1418
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the effect of glucocorticoid regimens on  renal response, infections, and mortality among patients with lupus nephritis  (LN). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the control  arms of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We included RCTs of biopsy-proven LN  that used a protocolized regimen of glucocorticoids in combination with  mycophenolic acid analogs or cyclophosphamide and reported the outcomes of  complete response (CR), serious infections, and death. The starting dosage of  glucocorticoids, tapering method, and administration of glucocorticoid pulses  were abstracted. Meta-analysis of proportions, meta-regression, and subgroup  meta-analysis were performed at 6 and 12 months for all outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty  RCT arms (3,231 patients with LN) were included. The predicted rates of CR,  serious infections, and death when starting on oral prednisone at 25 mg/day  without pulses were 19.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.3-31.5), 3.2% (95% CI  2.4-4.0), and 0.2% (95% CI 0.0-0.4), respectively. Starting on prednisone at 60  mg/day (without pulses) increased the rates to 34.6% (95% CI 16.9-52.3), 12.1%  (95% CI 9.3-14.9), and 2.7% (95% CI 0.0-5.3), respectively. Adding glucocorticoid  pulses increased the rates of CR and death but not serious infections. We  observed a dose-response gradient between the initial glucocorticoid dosage and  all the outcomes at six months after accounting for the administration of  glucocorticoid pulses, underlying immunosuppressant, and baseline proteinuria.  CONCLUSION: A higher exposure to glucocorticoids during the initial therapy of LN  was associated with better renal outcomes at the cost of increased infections and  death.

T1  - Efficacy and safety study of targeted small-molecule drugs in the treatment of 
SP  - 98
AB  - BACKGROUND: Targeted small-molecule drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) have attracted increasing attention from clinical  investigators. However, there is still a lack of evidence on the difference in  the efficacy and safety of different targeted small-molecule drugs. Therefore,  this study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of different targeted  small-molecule drugs for SLE. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on  targeted small-molecule drugs in the treatment of SLE in PubMed, Web of Science,  Embase, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched as of April 25, 2023.  Risk of bias assessment was performed for included studies using the Cochrane's  tool for evaluating the risk of bias. The primary outcome indicators were SRI-4  response, BICLA response, and adverse reaction. Because different doses and  courses of treatment were used in the included studies, Bayesian network  meta-regression was used to investigate the effect of different doses and courses  of treatment on efficacy and safety. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies were  included, involving 3,622 patients and 9 targeted small-molecule drugs. The  results of network meta-analysis showed that, in terms of improving SRI-4,  Deucravacitinib was significantly superior to that of Baricitinib (RR = 1.32, 95%  CI (1.04, 1.68), P < 0.05). Deucravacitinib significantly outperformed the  placebo in improving BICLA response (RR = 1.55, 95% CI (1.20, 2.02), P < 0.05).  In terms of adverse reactions, targeted small-molecule drugs did not  significantly increase the risk of adverse events as compared to placebo  (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence obtained in this study, the  differences in the efficacy of targeted small-molecule drugs were statistically  significant as compared to placebo, but the difference in the safety was not  statistically significant. The dose and the course of treatment had little impact  on the effect of targeted small-molecule drugs. Deucravacitinib could  significantly improve BICLA response and SRI-4 response without significantly  increasing the risk of AEs. Therefore, Deucravacitinib is very likely to be the  best intervention measure. Due to the small number of included studies, more  high-quality clinical evidence is needed to further verify the efficacy and  safety of targeted small-molecule drugs for SLE.

T1  - Considering belimumab during pregnancy: A more viable option over time.
SP  - 700-715
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To share our experience with belimumab in lupus pregnant women and to  review the relevant published literature on its use in this scenario. METHODS: A  prospective observational study of pregnant patients with lupus was conducted.  Additionally, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched, and a secondary hand  search of the literature was performed. Studies were evaluated and visualised  descriptively. RESULTS: Sixteen pregnancies of 12 lupus women were included, six  (involving eight pregnancies) received belimumab throughout their illness, five  of them during some period of gestation. In this group, there was one  miscarriage, one elective termination and seven live foetuses (including two live  twins). There was one type I intrauterine growth retardation, and a preterm  pregnancy due to premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). One mild lupus flare was  detected. There were no cases of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus or  hypertension. All neonates had normal Apgar scores at birth, none needed critical  care. There were no congenital anomalies. After the search, we identified 10 case  reports and case series, and five registries. Among the 39 reported cases (41  pregnancies), there were 5 PPROM, 4 pre-eclampsia, and 1 eclampsia. All women  made full recoveries. Nineteen new-borns had low birth weight. There were no  malformations. While registries did not indicate an increased risk of birth  defects or pregnancy loss, there was a higher risk of neonatal infections.  CONCLUSIONS: Belimumab may be an option for pregnant women with  difficult-to-control lupus. Further research is needed to confirm the absence of  association between belimumab and foetal harm.

T1  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-related Lung Disease.
SP  - 386-396
AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a multifaceted, multisystem autoimmune  disorder with diverse clinical expressions. While prevalence reports vary widely,  pulmonary involvement accounts for significant morbidity and mortality in SLE.  This comprehensive review explores the spectrum of pulmonary disease in SLE,  including upper airway manifestations (e.g., laryngeal affection), lower airway  conditions (e.g., bronchitis, bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis), parenchymal  diseases (e.g., interstitial lung disease, acute lupus pneumonitis, diffuse  alveolar hemorrhage), pleural diseases (e.g., serositis, shrinking lung  syndrome), and vascular diseases (e.g., pulmonary arterial hypertension,  pulmonary embolism, acute reversible hypoxemia syndrome). We discuss diagnostic  modalities, treatment strategies, and prognosis for each pulmonary manifestation.  With diagnostics remaining a challenge and with the absence of standardized  treatment guidelines, we emphasize the need for evidence-based guidelines to  optimize patient care and improve outcomes in this complex disease.

T1  - Examining the clinical and radiological landscape of rhupus: navigating the 
SP  - 1185-1196
AB  - Rhupus, in the broad sense, refers to an overlap between rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) and lupus. However, there is a paucity of data on the appropriate  diagnostic/classification criteria that should be used to define rhupus. Hence,  we undertook this narrative review to analyze the clinical characteristics,  radiology, and treatment with a focus on diagnostic challenges and defining  features of rhupus. The databases of Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and DOAJ were  searched for relevant articles using the following keywords: ("Rhupus"), ("lupus"  AND "erosive" AND "arthritis"), and ("lupus" AND "rheumatoid arthritis" AND  "overlap"). Studies have used a variety of classification criteria for rhupus of  which a combination of the latest classification criteria for RA and lupus along  with positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-Smith, and anti-dsDNA  antibodies seem most relevant. The majority of rhupus cohorts report the onset of  the disease as RA (two-thirds of rhupus patients) followed by the development of  features of lupus at an average interval of 3-11.3 years. The radiographic  features and distribution of erosions are similar to RA. However, ultrasonography  and MRI reveal erosions in pure lupus related arthritis as well. This makes the  reliability of radiologic tools for the evaluation of rhupus supportive at the  most. Extra-articular features in rhupus are mild with major organ involvement in  the form of neuropsychiatric lupus and lupus nephritis being rare. We have  further discussed the fallacies of the various classification criteria and  proposed a theme for classifying rhupus which needs to be tested and validated in  future studies. Our current state of understanding supports rhupus as an overlap  of SLE and RA with articular disease similar to RA with the extra-articular  disease being milder than SLE. Developing standardized classification criteria  for rhupus will help in the early diagnosis and prevention of articular damage in  patients with rhupus.

T1  - Pancytopenia with aplastic anemia in systemic lupus erythematosus: case series 
SP  - 943-953
AB  - Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare, potentially catastrophic hematopoiesis failure  manifested by pancytopenia and bone marrow aplasia. AA occurrence in Systemic  Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients is extremely rare. The diagnosis may be  delayed due to other possible pancytopenia etiologies. Confirmation of peripheral  cytopenias diagnosis necessitates a bone marrow aspiration. The management of AA  is challenging, and the literature reported using glucocorticoids, danazol,  plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine.  We report two cases of SLE patients who presented with pancytopenia, with bone  marrow biopsy confirmed AA. One case was treated with cyclophosphamide but  unfortunately succumbed to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), while the  other case was managed with rituximab with a good response. Interestingly, both  patients were on azathioprine before the diagnosis of AA. A comprehensive search  for reported cases of AA in PubMed, Scopus, and the Directory of Open Access  Journals databases was performed to enhance the understanding of the diagnostic  and management challenges associated with AA in SLE, facilitating ongoing  exploration and research in this field. The decision to do a BM aspiration and  biopsy is recommended for SLE patients with an abrupt decline in blood counts and  previously stable blood counts.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus presenting with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome: 
SP  - 2213-2225
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can present with a diverse array of  hematologic manifestations, among which atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)  is a rare entity. SLE-triggered aHUS has significant morbidity and mortality  without timely intervention, yet its frequency remains uncertain and optimal  strategies for complement-directed therapies are largely expert-driven. We  performed a comprehensive literature review and present a case of a 23-year-old  female newly diagnosed with SLE/class IV lupus nephritis who developed aHUS that  rapidly responded to the C5 antagonist, eculizumab. Review of the current  literature identified forty-nine published cases of SLE with concurrent aHUS and  revealed a predilection for aHUS in younger SLE patients, concurrent presentation  with lupus nephritis, anti-dsDNA positivity, and complement system abnormalities.  Over seventy percent of cases used eculizumab as complement-directed therapy with  a trend towards faster time to improvement in laboratory parameters, though  reported outcomes were highly variable. Early recognition of aHUS in SLE is  pivotal in guiding appropriate therapeutic interventions, and prompt initiation  of eculizumab may reduce the potential morbidity associated with plasmapheresis  and additional immunosuppression. While eculizumab showcases promising results,  its optimal timing and duration remain elusive. An understanding of a patients'  complement genetics could aid management strategies, and ongoing research into  complement-targeted therapies offers promising avenues for both SLE and aHUS  treatment.

T1  - Pulmonary Hypertension in Connective Tissue Diseases Other than Systemic 
SP  - 419-434
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a known complication of certain connective tissue  diseases (CTDs), with systemic sclerosis (SSc) being the most common in the  Western world. However, PH in association with non-SSc CTD such as systemic lupus  erythematous, mixed connective tissue disease, and primary Sjogren's syndrome  constitutes a distinct subset of patients with inherently different epidemiologic  profiles, pathophysiologic mechanisms, clinical features, therapeutic options,  and prognostic implications. The purpose of this review is to inform a practical  approach for clinicians evaluating patients with non-SSc CTD-associated PH.The  development of PH in these patients involves a complex interplay between genetic  factors, immune-mediated mechanisms, and endothelial cell dysfunction.  Furthermore, the broad spectrum of CTD manifestations can contribute to the  development of PH through various pathophysiologic mechanisms, including  intrinsic pulmonary arteriolar vasculopathy (pulmonary arterial hypertension,  Group 1 PH), left-heart disease (Group 2), chronic lung disease (Group 3),  chronic pulmonary artery obstruction (Group 4), and unclear and/or multifactorial  mechanisms (Group 5). The importance of diagnosing PH early in symptomatic  patients with non-SSc CTD is highlighted, with a review of the relevant  biomarkers, imaging, and diagnostic procedures required to establish a  diagnosis.Therapeutic strategies for non-SSc PH associated with CTD are explored  with an in-depth review of the medical, interventional, and surgical options  available to these patients, emphasizing the CTD-specific considerations that  guide treatment and aid in prognosis. By identifying gaps in the current  literature, we offer insights into future research priorities that may prove  valuable for patients with PH associated with non-SSc CTD.

T1  - Animal models of lupus nephritis: the past, present and a future outlook.
SP  - 2319203
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most severe end-organ pathology in Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus (SLE). Research has enhanced our understanding of immune effectors  and inflammatory pathways in LN. However, even with the best available therapy,  the rate of complete remission for proliferative LN remains below 50%. A deeper  understanding of the resistance or susceptibility of renal cells to injury during  the progression of SLE is critical for identifying new targets and developing  effective long-term therapies. The complex and heterogeneous nature of LN,  combined with the limitations of clinical research, make it challenging to  investigate the aetiology of this disease directly in patients. Hence, multiple  murine models resembling SLE-driven nephritis are utilised to dissect LN's  cellular and genetic mechanisms, identify therapeutic targets, and screen novel  compounds. This review discusses commonly used spontaneous and inducible mouse  models that have provided insights into pathogenic mechanisms and long-term  maintenance therapies in LN.

T1  - Assessing the steroid-sparing effect of biological agents in randomized 
SP  - 538-553
AB  - Prompt disease control of flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) is a priority in treatment strategy planning. However, the long-term  dosage-related collateral effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) have pushed  researchers towards the identification and utilization of novel biological agents  that could both induce and maintain low disease activity and remission,  especially in the context of lupus nephritis (LN). This scoping review aims at  assessing the current evidence of the potential steroid-sparing effect of  biologic therapies by reviewing phase II and phase III randomized,  placebo-controlled trials involving SLE/LN patients. A scoping review of the  literature was carried out in accordance with PRISMA-ScR recommendations. Risk of  bias was assessed through the utilization of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool  for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria  and were included in this analysis (treatment drug, 7 belimumab; 1 anifrolumab).  Four studies showed a definite steroid-sparing effect (treatment drug, 3  belimumab; 1 anifrolumab), while in the remaining four RCTs, the steroid-sparing  effect was not observed. When focusing on phase III trials, the overall quality  of the studies resulted fair or good considering the risk of bias. However, a  degree of heterogeneity of steroid regimen protocol (considering initial dosage,  tapering and rescue treatment allowance) was observed. While a growing body of  evidence is supporting the safety and efficacy of biological treatment in SLE,  the evidence on their steroid-sparing effect remains scattered. Future research  needs to pursue the identification of precise SLE clusters of patients who would  benefit most from a specific treatment protocol with a definite steroid-sparing  effect.

T1  - Issues with pregnancy in systemic lupus.
SP  - 105713
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a disease that affects a large number of young  women of childbearing age. Today, pregnancy is considered safe in almost all  women with lupus, especially when the disease is under control. However,  pregnancies in this population have a higher risk of maternal complications than  in the general population. It is therefore important to plan pregnancies as  effectively as possible, using effective contraception and pre-pregnancy  counselling. In fact, effective, well-tolerated contraception is essential for  patients for whom pregnancy cannot be safely envisaged, particularly in the  setting of teratogenic treatment or significant disease activity. Preconception  counselling is essential and helps to anticipate several aspects of a future  pregnancy. Several recent prospective studies have clearly identified risk  factors for obstetric complications and disease flare. High level of lupus  activity, low complement, primigravida and a history of lupus nephritis are  predictive factors of disease flare when antiphospholipid syndrome or  antiphospholipid antibodies (specifically for lupus anticoagulant), damage,  activity of lupus are predictive for obstetric events. Appropriate therapeutic  management is essential, based primarily on the continuation of  hydroxychloroquine, although some recent warnings about its use in pregnancy have  been discussed controversially. Corticosteroid therapy can be continued at the  lowest possible dose, as can certain immunosuppressive drugs. In the case of a  history of lupus nephritis, low-dose aspirin is also prescribed. Although still  exceptional, the risk of neonatal lupus is also higher, in patients with anti-SSA  and anti-SSB antibodies. The aim of this review is to summarise the risk factors  for adverse obstetric outcomes and to improve medical and obstetric management in  this population of pregnant women with lupus.

SP  - 793-801
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article aims to evaluate the magnitude of adverse pregnancy  outcomes (APOs) risks associated with different antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)  profiles in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Multiple  databases were investigated to identify articles that explored the relationship  between aPLs and APOs in SLE patients. A random effects model was used for  calculating pooled odds ratios (OR). Stata version 15.0 was utilized to conduct  the meta-analysis. RESULTS: There were 5234 patients involved in 30 studies.  Overall aPL was linked to an increased incidence of any kind of APOs, fetal loss,  and preterm birth. Any kind of APOs and preterm delivery were more common in  patients with lupus anticoagulant (LA) positive. Anticardiolipin antibody (aCL)  was associated with an increased risk of any kind of APOs and fetal loss. The  association between aCL-IgM and fetal loss was also significant. Patients with  anti-beta2-glycoprotein1 antibody (antibeta2GP1) positivity had an increased risk of  fetal loss. CONCLUSIONS: Both LA and aCL were risk factors of APOs in patients  with SLE. Not only ACL, particularly aCL-IgM, but antibeta2GP1 were associated with  an increased risk of fetal loss, while LA appeared to indicate the risk of  preterm birth.PROSPERO (CRD42023388122).

T1  - Clinical patterns of disease: From early systemic lupus erythematosus to 
SP  - 101938
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease with an insidious  clinical presentation. In up to half of the cases, SLE onset is characterized by  clinical and serological manifestations that, although specific, are insufficient  to fulfill the classification criteria. This condition, called incomplete SLE,  could be as challenging as the definite and classifiable SLE and requires to be  treated according to the severity of clinical manifestations. In addition, an  early SLE diagnosis and therapeutic intervention can positively influence the  disease outcome, including remission rate and damage accrual. After diagnosis,  the disease course is relapsing-remitting for most patients. Time in remission  and cumulative glucocorticoid exposure are the most important factors for  prognosis. Therefore, timely identification of SLE clinical patterns may help  tailor the therapeutic intervention to the disease course. Late-onset SLE is rare  but more often associated with delayed diagnosis and a higher incidence of  comorbidities, including Sjogren's syndrome. This review focuses on the SLE  disease course, providing actionable strategies for early diagnosis, an overview  of the possible clinical patterns of SLE, and the clinical variation associated  with the different age-at-onset SLE groups.

T1  - Clinical trial outcomes for SLE: what we have and what we need.
AB  - The paradigm of drug approval in SLE currently relies on successful large phase  III randomised controlled trials and a set of primary, secondary and additional  end points. Taken together, these outcomes offer a nuanced understanding of the  efficacy and safety of the investigational agent. In this review, we thoroughly  examine the main outcomes used in SLE trials and highlight unmet requirements as  well as potential venues for future trial design in SLE. Disease activity indices  can be broadly categorised into global-specific and organ-specific indices, in  particular for skin, joints and kidneys, but there is no universal consensus  about their use in clinical trials. Because each of these instruments has its own  intrinsic strengths and weaknesses, the assessment of treatment response has  progressed from relying solely on one individual disease activity index to using  composite responder definitions. Those are typically measured from the trial  baseline to the end point assessment date and may be combined with the need to  taper and maintain glucocorticoids (GCs) within prespecified ranges. Remission  and low disease activity are two critical states in the perspective of  'Treat-to-Target' trials, but are not fully recognised by regulators. While  significant progress has been made in clinical trial outcomes for SLE, there is a  clear need for continued innovation. Addressing these challenges will require  collaboration between researchers, clinicians, patients as well as with  regulatory agencies to refine existing outcome measures, incorporate meaningful  and ethnically diverse patient perspectives, foster relevant digital  opportunities and explore new therapeutic avenues, including early use of  investigational agents. By doing so, we can advance our ability to manage SLE  effectively and safely and improve the lives of those living with this complex  and impactful autoimmune disease.

T1  - CAR-T cells for treating systemic lupus erythematosus: A promising emerging 
SP  - 105702
AB  - Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T), currently employed routinely  for treating B-cell malignancies, has emerged as a groundbreaking approach in  addressing severe autoimmune diseases, especially for systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). The immunological rationale for targeting B lymphocytes in  autoimmune diseases is well-established, demonstrating success in numerous  autoantibody-mediated autoimmune conditions through targeted therapies over  several years. However, this approach has often proven ineffective in the context  of systemic lupus erythematosus. Recent data on CAR-T usage in lupus, revealed  promising results including rapid and prolonged remission without treatment,  highlighting the potential of CAR-T therapy in severe lupus cases. This article  provides a comprehensive overview of CAR-T cells, tracing their evolution from  hematological malignancies to their recent applications in autoimmune disorder,  especially in lupus. Clinical trials within a regulated framework are now  imperative to assess the procedural aspects in order to validate the considerable  promise of CAR-T cell therapy in the field of autoimmune diseases. This includes  evaluating safety and long-term efficacy and security of the procedure, the  benefit-risk ratio in the field of autoimmunity, the availability and  cost-related issues associated with this emerging cellular therapy procedure.

T1  - New guidelines and therapeutic updates for the management of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 344-353
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be a devastating  condition, striking young patients often in their prime reproductive years. Lupus  nephritis is a common and serious complication occurring in roughly 50% of SLE  cases, indicating a high likelihood of disease progression, morbidity, and  mortality. As the early trials of steroid therapy, and later cyclophosphamide  (CYC), therapeutic changes had been stagnant. Then came the introduction of  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the 2000s. After the Aspreva Lupus Management  Study, there had been a dearth of trials showing positive therapy results. Since  2020, new studies have emerged for lupus nephritis involving the use of anti-BLYS  agents, novel calcineurin inhibitors, CD20 blockade, and antiinterferon agents.  Nephrology and rheumatology society guidelines in the United States and across  the world are still catching up. RECENT FINDINGS: Although therapeutic guidelines  are being developed, updates that have come through have focused on improved  diagnostic and monitoring guidelines. One theme is the recommendation of  increasingly tight proteinuria control and firmer guidelines for the rapid  induction of remission. The reality of multitarget therapy and the expectation of  rapid induction for a more complete remission are being widely recognized.  SUMMARY: The need for more complete and more rapid induction and control of lupus  nephritis is undisputed according to the evidence and guidelines, and the  medications to achieve this are growing at a rate not seen over the prior two  decades. What remains is a stepwise approach to recognize how to best optimize  therapy. Based on available evidence, an algorithm for induction and maintenance  treatment of lupus nephritis used by the University of California Irvine Lupus  Nephritis clinic, is recommended.

SP  - 414-419
AB  - Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated hepatitis ("lupus  hepatitis") was one of the most frequent causes of liver function abnormalities  in patients with SLE. Lupus hepatitis (LH) is commonly treated with conventional  treatment, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and  immunomodulators. However, in refractory cases, other treatment options may be  required.Methodology: We report the case of a patient with lupus hepatitis  refractory to both conventional therapy and belimumab who was successfully  treated with telitacicept, a new dual B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)/APRIL (a  proliferation-inducing ligand) inhibitor.Literature review was performed on  PubMed search forum.Result: The specific search term was "telitacicept", 23  papers were searched, among them 10 case reports/series articles reporting  telitacicept treatment were elected.Apart from our literature reporting the  effectiveness of telitacicept in treating LH, there is no report on it in  treating LH.Conclusion: This case suggests that telitacicept should be an  effective and safe treatment for LH refractory, even to those who failed to  belimumab based on the standard treatment, and can reduce the dosage of  glucocorticoids.However, further investigations, particularly prospective  randomized controlled trials, are warranted to verify our findings and ensure  patient safety.

SP  - 503-511
AB  - A complication of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) is immune  thrombocytopenia (ITP). Although corticosteroids and immunoglobulins are  frequently used as preliminary treatments, some patients do not respond to them.  Rituximab has been reported to be safe and effective in the treatment of pSLE  complicated with refractory ITP. Research is currently underway to determine the  optimal rituximab dose for these individuals. We report a case of a child with  SLE-associated ITP (SLE-ITP) who was successfully treated with rituximab.  Rituximab is likely the most viable therapeutic option for refractory SLE-ITP.  Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the relevant literature was performed and  a concise overview of the pathogenesis and available treatment modalities for  pediatric patients diagnosed with SLE and concurrent ITP was provided.

SP  - 81-85
AB  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is caused by the transmission of maternal  anti-Ro/SSA antibodies, anti-La/SSB antibodies, and other autoantibodies to the  fetus through the placenta. Usually, with the disappearance of autoantibodies in  the children's body, abnormal changes in the mucocutaneous, blood system, and  digestive system can spontaneously subside, but the damage to various systems  caused by autoantibodies may persist for a long time. This article provides a  comprehensive review of the manifestations and prognosis of NLE in various  systems, including mucocutaneous, blood system, circulatory system, nervous  system, digestive system, respiratory system, aiming to provide reference for  clinical work.

T1  - Lupus Nephritis Biomarkers: A Critical Review.
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN), a major complication in individuals diagnosed with systemic  lupus erythematosus, substantially increases morbidity and mortality. Despite  marked improvements in the survival of patients with severe LN over the past 50  years, complete clinical remission after immunosuppressive therapy is achieved in  only half of the patients. Therefore, timely detection of LN is vital for  initiating prompt therapeutic interventions and improving patient outcomes.  Biomarkers have emerged as valuable tools for LN detection and monitoring;  however, the complex role of these biomarkers in LN pathogenesis remains unclear.  Renal biopsy remains the gold standard for the identification of the histological  phenotypes of LN and guides disease management. However, the molecular  pathophysiology of specific renal lesions remains poorly understood. In this  review, we provide a critical, up-to-date overview of the latest developments in  the field of LN biomarkers.

T1  - Evolution of diagnosis and treatment for lupus nephritis in Spain.
SP  - 668-675
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a serious manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus  that can lead to end-stage renal disease. Many clinical and prognostic data on  which our therapeutic decisions are based come from international cohorts, which  have important ethnic and prognostic differences. To identify clinical and  prognostic data from patients with LN in Spain, we undertook a bibliographic  search of NL-related papers by Spanish authors and published in national and  international journals between 2005 and 2022. According to the selected  references, renal biopsy is not only essential for LN diagnosis but its  repetition can be useful for the follow-up. Regarding LN treatment, standard  strategy consists of an induction phase and a maintenance phase. However, as new  drugs have been released, a new paradigm of treatment in a single, continuing and  personalized phase has been proposed.

T1  - Calcineurin inhibitors in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus during 
SP  - 148-155
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) predominantly affects child-bearing women,  leading to an elevated risk of maternal and fetal complications and adverse  pregnancy outcomes. Since some medications can cross the placental barrier that  persist a threat to both mother and fetus, the risk-benefit ratio of SLE  medications should be taken into consideration during pregnancy. Calcineurin  inhibitor (CNI), mainly including cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, and voclosporin, is  a category of immunosuppressive agents that inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent  phosphatase calcineurin to block T cell activation. Based on the current clinical  evidence, CNI is an alternative in pregnant SLE patients with persistent disease  activity (especially lupus nephritis patients) and non-responders to  azathioprine. However, there is no comprehensive review that summarizes the  efficacy and safety profile of CNI for SLE management during pregnancy. This  review presents a summary on the utilization of CNI for SLE management during  pregnancy, including the mechanism of action, gestational amelioration of lupus  flare, and the balance of maternal benefit-fetal risk, which may provide more  references for the management of SLE pregnancies.

T1  - Lupus enteritis: a narrative review.
SP  - 1494-1501
AB  - Lupus enteritis (LE) is a rare manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. The  pathophysiology of LE has not been fully elucidated, although inflammatory and  thrombotic processes are likely important factors. The underlying  pathophysiological mechanisms may depend on which portion of the intestine is  affected. Over half of the patients with LE also present with renal or  haematological complications. The diagnosis of LE is based on clinical,  histopathological and imaging findings; abdominal computed tomography (CT) is the  gold standard in diagnosis. Abdominal CT can also identify factors that predict  complications and could potentially guide pharmacological and nutritional  management. Timely identification and prompt treatment initiation are paramount  to avoid life and organ threatening complications. Glucocorticoids are often the  first-line treatment. Additional therapy including immunosuppressive therapy is  utilised on a case-by-case basis as there are no clinical trials to define the  optimal therapeutic approach. Surgical intervention may be needed especially if  there is bowel perforation or peritonitis. In general, the prognosis of LE is  good.

T1  - Predictors and prognostic factors influencing outcomes of anti-CD20 monoclonal 
SP  - 152346
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-C20 monoclonal antibodies (MAb), such as rituximab, are commonly  used for the treatment of patients with severe or refractory systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) but clinical outcomes are highly variable. We aimed to  provide an update of a systematic review of predictive and prognostic factors of  anti-CD20 MAb treatment in SLE. METHODS: A systematic literature search was  undertaken to identify predictive and prognostic factors of clinical response  following treatment with anti-CD20 therapies in SLE patients. Studies examining  rituximab published prior to 2015 were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed for  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane Collaboration (RoB2) tool  for RCTs and the Quality In Prognosis Studies Tool (QUIPS) for cohort studies. A  narrative synthesis of the evidence was undertaken and quality of evidence (QoE)  was assessed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: From 850 studies  identified, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. A further 8 studies were  identified and included through search updates. There were two post-hoc analyses  of RCTs of rituximab, one RCT of ocrelizumab and one of obinutuzumab; and 16  cohort studies examining rituximab treatment. The overall QoE was low or very  low. There was wide heterogeneity in definitions of clinical disease activity and  outcome measures, non-standardized laboratory cut-offs, failure to account for  confounders and multiple subgroup analyses of differing outcomes. B cell  depletion as well as novel biomarkers, such as S100 proteins, FCGR genotype,  anti-vimentin and anti-drug antibodies showed some evidence of prognostic value  but QoE was limited due to moderate to high risk of bias, early phase of  investigation and imprecision of results. CONCLUSION: There has been no  validation of previously identified prognostic factors to guide outcome in  anti-CD20 treated lupus patients. Hypothesis-driven studies of several novel  markers however, demonstrate prognostic value and require replication and  validation to support their use in routine clinical practice.

T1  - An overlapping case of IgG4-related disease and systemic lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 549-556
AB  - IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic condition in which IgG4(+) plasma  cell infiltration and fibrosis cause organ swelling and lead to diverse clinical  manifestations. Although IgG4-RD typically responds to glucocorticoids (GCs),  relapse during tapering occurs and an early GC-sparing approach might therefore  be beneficial. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory  disease with multiple symptoms that is also treated with GCs as a first-line  therapy. Recently, belimumab, a recombinant human IgG-1lambda monoclonal antibody that  inhibits B-cell activating factor, was approved, but reports of use for IgG4-RD  are scarce. Here, we present a rare case of IgG4-RD complicated with SLE which  was successfully treated with belimumab. A 67-year-old man was diagnosed with  IgG4-RD based on a high serum IgG4 level and histopathological findings.  Furthermore, he had pericardial effusion on echocardiography, and laboratory  tests revealed thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolysis, positive anti-nuclear  antibodies, positive anti-DNA antibodies, and hypocomplementemia. These data led  to an SLE diagnosis. Treatment was started with prednisolone at 40 mg/day, plus  hydroxychloroquine, which initially improved both the SLE and IgG4-RD symptoms.  During the GC tapering, belimumab was added and clinical symptoms resolved  completely. Our case and the literature review summarize reported rare  overlapping cases of IgG4-RD and SLE and suggest that belimumab is a promising  candidate for the treatment of IgG4-RD.

T1  - Managing Lupus Nephritis in Children and Adolescents.
SP  - 145-161
AB  - Lupus nephritis is an important manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus,  which leads to chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and can result in  mortality. About 35%-60% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus develop  kidney involvement. Over the past few decades, the outcome of patients with lupus  nephritis has improved significantly with advances in immunosuppressive therapies  and clinical management. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of high-level evidence  to guide the management of childhood-onset lupus nephritis, because of the  relatively small number of patients at each centre and also because children and  adolescents are often excluded from clinical trials. Children and adults differ  in more ways than just size, and there are remarkable differences between  childhood- and adult-onset lupus nephritis in terms of disease severity,  treatment efficacy, tolerance to medications and most importantly, psychosocial  perspective. In this article, we review the 'art and science' of managing  childhood-onset lupus nephritis, which has evolved in recent years, and highlight  special considerations in this specific patient population.

SP  - 2290365
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of  immunosuppressive agents, specifically Voclosporin, when used in conjunction with  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) induction therapy for the management of lupus  nephritis (LN). METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) was  conducted on randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of  immunosuppressant-induced therapy for LN. The random effects model was used in  the analysis. I(2) was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the model. Odds  ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were computed to assess and compare  the relative effectiveness and safety of various treatment protocols. RESULTS:  The study included a total of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving  2444 patients with LN. The analysis results indicated that there was no  significant difference in terms of partial remission (PR) between the drugs.  However, when considering complete remission (CR), the combination of Voclosporin  with MMF showed the highest remission rate, followed by Tacrolimus (TAC).  Unfortunately, Voclosporin in combination with MMF had the highest risk of  infection and serious infection, indicating a lower safety profile. CONCLUSIONS:  Voclosporin in combination with MMF demonstrated the highest efficacy as an  induction therapy for LN. However, it should be noted that the risk of infection  and serious infection was found to be high with this regimen. On the other hand,  TAC not only showed efficacy but also had a lower risk of infection and serious  infection, making it a favorable option in terms of safety. This study did' not  include results on other adverse events.

T1  - Safety and efficacy of biologics in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus: a 
SP  - 863-877
AB  - Biologic agents are increasingly being used to treat adult patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the available data on biologic agents' use in  childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) remains limited. To collate available evidence related  to the efficacy and safety of using biologic agents in cSLE. The study followed  the PRISMA checklist for reporting the data and conducted a thorough search using  PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus from January 2005 to August 2023. Only  articles meeting specific criteria were included, focusing on cSLE, the use of  biologic agents, and having outcome measures at six- and 12-month follow-ups for  safety and efficacy. Case reports were excluded, and four independent reviewers  screened the articles for accuracy, with a fifth reviewer resolving any  discrepancies that arose to achieve a consensus. The final selection included 18  studies with a total of 593 patients treated with biologic agents for severe and/  or refractory cSLE. The most common indication for using biologic agents was  lupus nephritis. Rituximab was used in 12 studies, while belimumab was used in  six studies. The studies evaluated the efficacy of biologic agents based on SLE  disease activity scores, laboratory parameter improvements, and reduced  corticosteroid dosage. Positive outcomes were reported, with improvements in  renal, hematologic, and immunologic parameters along with mild adverse effects,  mostly related to mild infections and infusion reactions. Belimumab and rituximab  have shown promise as potential treatments for severe and refractory cSLE cases,  leading to decreased disease activity and complete or partial remission in many  patients with an acceptable safety profile. However, further research is needed  to better understand their benefits and potential risks in these patients. Key  Points * This review emphasizes the lack of sufficient randomized controlled  trials exploring the use of biologics in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus  (cSLE). * Treatment plans for cSLE are being derived from those used for adult  systemic lupus erythematosus. * According to current evidence, belimumab and  rituximab can be potential treatment options for refractory and severe cases of  cSLE. * Additional studies are required to reach more definitive conclusions.

T1  - Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: new therapeutic options.
SP  - 629-639
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease  of unknown cause, with heterogeneity in its clinical presentation, as well as  variability in its clinical course and prognosis. The current goal of treatment  is to achieve disease remission or a state of low activity, and thereby improve  the patient's quality of life. Biological therapy in lupus, unlike other  entities, although it has not been fully established, in recent years it has  burst onto the scene with important therapeutic novelties. This review aims to  update the therapeutic tools for the treatment of SLE focusing on the new  molecules that have achieved the objectives of their clinical trials.

T1  - Autoimmune diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes: an umbrella review.
SP  - S84
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of autoimmune conditions is two-fold higher in women  than in men, especially during the reproductive years. Autoimmune conditions have  been associated with a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and some  conditions have been studied more than others with inconsistent findings. The  objective of this umbrella review was to identify, appraise, synthesise, and  consolidate findings from published systematic reviews of autoimmune conditions  and adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: In this umbrella review, we searched  Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for systematic reviews from inception to  Sept 30, 2022, without language restrictions. We used the Medical Subject  Headings and free text search for autoimmune conditions and pregnancy outcomes.  Screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were done by two  independent reviewers. Data was extracted using a standardised form, which was  piloted before use. Data were synthesised narratively and quantitatively. Odds  ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were reported. The protocol has been registered to  PROSPERO (CRD42022334992). FINDINGS: We selected 33 reviews, which included 709  primary studies. Pregnant women with autoimmune conditions were at high risk of  both adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The risk of miscarriage was increased  in pregnant women with Sjogren's syndrome (relative risk [RR] 8.85, 95% CI  3.10-25.26), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OR 4.90, 95% CI 3.10-7.69),  thyroid autoimmunity (OR 2.77, 2.10-3.65), systemic sclerosis (OR 1.60,  1.29-2.22), and coeliac disease (OR 1.38, 1.12-1.69). The risk of pre-eclampsia  was increased in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; OR 4.19, 3.08-5.71)  and SLE (OR 3.20, 2.54 - 4.20). The risk of gestational diabetes was increased in  pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; OR 2.96, 1.47-5.98) and  thyroid autoimmunity (OR 1.49, 1.07-2.07). The risk of intrauterine growth  restriction (IUGR) was increased in pregnant women with systemic sclerosis (OR  3.20, 2.21-4.53) and coeliac disease (OR 1.71, 1.36-2.14). The risk of delivering  a small-for-gestational age baby was increased in pregnant women with SLE (OR  2.49, 1.88-3.31) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR 1.49, 1.22-1.82). The risks of  other fetal outcomes such as stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birthweight were  also increased in pregnant women with autoimmune disorders. T1DM in women was  associated with lower odds of small-for-gestational-age outcome (OR 0.68,  0.56-0.83). INTERPRETATION: Pregnant women with autoimmune conditions are at  greater risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further research is  required to develop better preconception to post-natal care for women with  autoimmune conditions.

T1  - Management of systemic lupus erythematosus: A new scenario.
SP  - 101895
AB  - The introduction of targeted biological agents in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) has created a momentum for improving overall disease management and  patients' prognosis. To achieve this, a comprehensive strategy is required  spanning the entire patient journey from diagnosis to prevention and management  of late complications and comorbidities. In this review, we focus on four aspects  that are closely linked to SLE prognosis, namely early disease recognition and  treatment initiation, reduction of the cumulative glucocorticoid exposure,  attainment of well-defined targets of remission and low disease activity,  prevention of flares and, kidney-protective strategies with non-immune-directed  agents. We review the recent literature related to these topics in conjunction  with the existing treatment recommendations, highlighting areas of uncertainty  and providing guidance towards facilitating the care of SLE patients.

Achieving remission or low disease activity for several  months on medications compatible with pregnancy prior to conception is essential  to decreasing the risk of disease flare and improving pregnancy outcomes,  including pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. With  close management and well-controlled disease before and during pregnancy, <10% of  patients flare. All patients with SLE should remain on hydroxychloroquine unless  contraindicated. Expectant mothers with a history of antiphospholipid syndrome  should be treated with anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy. Women with  anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies require additional monitoring because their  offspring are at increased risk for congenital heart block. Patients with SLE  should be offered low-dose aspirin starting at the end of the first trimester to  reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia. Flares of SLE during pregnancy require  escalation of therapy. The immunosuppressives azathioprine, tacrolimus, and  cyclosporine are compatible with pregnancy, and biologic agents can also be  considered. Glucocorticoid use in pregnancy should be limited to the lowest  effective dose. Mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid, methotrexate,  leflunomide, and cyclophosphamide are known to be teratogenic and are  contraindicated in pregnancy. Distinguishing a flare of lupus nephritis during  pregnancy from pre-eclampsia can be particularly challenging. Overall, outcomes  in pregnancy for women with lupus are improving, but gaps in knowledge about  optimal management strategies persist.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of immunosuppressive agents for adults with lupus nephritis: 
SP  - 1232244
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Various immunosuppressive regimens have been developed for the  treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). This study aimed to compare the efficacy and  safety of immunosuppressive regimens in adults with LN. METHODS: We  systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of  Controlled Trials databases, including conference proceedings, trial registries,  and reference lists, from inception until July 10, 2022. The effects of treatment  were compared and ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve  (SUCRA). The primary endpoint was total remission. The secondary endpoints were  complete remission, systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI),  relapse, all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), infection, herpes  zoster, ovarian failure, myelosuppression, and cancer. RESULTS: Sixty-two trials  reported in 172 studies involving 6,936 patients were included in the network  meta-analysis. The combination of tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF),  and glucocorticoid (GC) provided the best result for the total remission rate  (SUCRA, 86.63%) and SLEDAI (SUCRA, 91.00%), while the combination of voclosporin  (VCS) , MMF and GC gave the best improvement in the complete remission rate  (SUCRA, 90.71%). The combination of cyclophosphamide (CYC), MMF and GC was  associated with the lowest risk of relapse (SUCRA, 85.57%) and cancer (SUCRA,  85.14%), while the combination of obinutuzumab (OTB), MMF and GC was associated  with the lowest risk of all-cause mortality (SUCRA, 84.07%). Rituximab (RTX) plus  MMF plus GC was associated with the lowest risk of ESRD (SUCRA, 83.11%), while  the risk of infection was lowest in patients treated with azathioprine (AZA) plus  CYC plus GC (SUCRA, 68.59%). TAC plus GC was associated with the lowest risk of  herpes zoster (SUCRA, 87.67%) and ovarian failure (SUCRA, 73.60%). Cyclosporine  (CsA) plus GC was associated with the lowest risk of myelosuppression (SUCRA,  79.50%), while AZA plus GC was associated with the highest risk of  myelosuppression (SUCRA, 16.25%). DISCUSSION: This study showed that a  combination of TAC, MMF and GC was the best regimen for improving the total  remission rate. The optimal regimen for specific outcomes should be highlighted  for high-risk patients.

T1  - Lupus Nephritis in Children: Novel Perspectives.
AB  - Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus is an inflammatory and autoimmune  condition characterized by heterogeneous multisystem involvement and a chronic  course with unpredictable flares. Kidney involvement, commonly called lupus  nephritis, mainly presents with immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis and is  more frequent and severe in adults. Despite a considerable improvement in  long-term renal prognosis, children and adolescents with lupus nephritis still  experience significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, current literature  often lacks pediatric-specific data, leading clinicians to rely exclusively on  adult therapeutic approaches. This review aims to describe pediatric lupus  nephritis and provide an overview of the novel perspectives on the pathogenetic  mechanisms, histopathological classification, therapeutic approach, novel  biomarkers, and follow-up targets in children and adolescents with lupus  nephritis.

SP  - 103467
AB  - BACKGROUND: Complement levels have been proposed as candidate biomarkers of  disease activity and obstetric risk in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  pregnancies, but their reliability has been questioned due to the physiologic  fluctuations of complement during gestation. Thus, this network meta-analysis  aimed at assessing the clinical significance of complement fluctuations in lupus  pregnant women. METHODS: Corresponding authors of 19 studies meeting inclusion  criteria were invited to contribute with additional data including C3 and C4  levels [before pregnancy, at conception, in every trimester (T) and 3 months  after delivery]; data were pooled together in a network meta-analysis. RESULTS: A  total of 532 lupus women from four studies were included in the analysis. In SLE  women, C3 and C4 increased progressively during gestation: levels remained stable  during T1 and peaked in T2 to decrease in T3. Patients with previous lupus  nephritis (LN) and those who experienced flares during pregnancy had  significantly lower mean levels of C3 and C4 at all timepoints. The lowest levels  of complement were observed, particularly during T1, in patients with LN and  gestational flare. Both reduction and the lack of increase of C3 and C4 levels at  T1 versus conception were associated with gestational flares, particularly in LN  patients. Pregnancies with flare had a statistically significant higher rate of  maternal and fetal complications(60% versus 50.3%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low  complement levels, particularly in T1, were associated with a higher frequency of  gestational flare. Either reduction or smaller increase of C3 and/or C4 levels,  even within normal range, might predict flares especially in early gestation.

T1  - Selection of indicators reporting response rate in pharmaceutical trials for 
AB  - OBJECTIVE: SLE is a common multisystem autoimmune disease with chronic  inflammation. Many efficacy evaluation indicators of randomised clinical trials  (RCTs) for SLE have been proposed but the comparability remains unknown. We aim  to explore the preference and comparability of indicators reporting response rate  and provide basis for primary outcome selection when evaluating the efficacy of  SLE pharmaceutical treatment. METHODS: We systematically searched three databases  and three registries to identify pharmacological intervention-controlled SLE  RCTs. Relative discriminations between indicators were assessed by the Bayesian  hierarchical linear mixed model. RESULTS: 33 RCTs met our inclusion criteria and  we compared eight of the most commonly used indicators reporting response rate.  SLE Disease Activity Index 4 (SLEDAI-4) and SLE Responder Index 4 were considered  the best recommended indicators reporting response rate to discriminate the  pharmacological efficacy. Indicator preference was altered by disease severity,  classification of drugs and outcome of trials, but SLEDAI-4 had robust efficacy  in discriminating ability for most interventions. Of note, BILAG Index-based  Combined Lupus Assessment showed efficacy in trials covering all-severity  patients, as well as non-biologics RCTs. The British Isles Lupus Assessment Group  response and Physician's Global Assessment response were more cautious in  evaluating disease changes. Serious adverse event was often applied to evaluate  the safety and tolerability of treatments rather than efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The  impressionable efficacy discrimination ability of indicators highlights the  importance of flexibility and comprehensiveness when choosing primary outcome(s).  As for trials that are only evaluated by SLEDAI-4, attention should be paid to  outcome interpretation to avoid the exaggeration of treatment efficacy. Further  subgroup analyses are limited by the number of included RCTs. PROSPERO  REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42022334517.

T1  - The effects of hydroxychloroquine and its promising use in refractory obstetric 
SP  - 223-234
AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is obtained by hydroxylation of chloroquine (CQ) and the  first indication was malaria. Nowadays, HCQ is commonly used in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with favorable results.  Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by  thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity and persistent positivity of  antiphospholipid antibodies. Around 20-30% of pregnant women with APS develop  adverse pregnancy outcomes despite conventional treatment with aspirin and  heparin, called refractory obstetric APS. Interestingly, HCQ has shown positive  effects on top of the standard of care in some refractory obstetric APS patients.  HCQ mechanisms of action in APS comprise its ability to bind sialic acid present  in cell membranes, its capacity to block the binding of antiphospholipid  antibodies to the cell and the induced increase of pH in extracellular and  intracellular compartments. However, the precise mechanisms of HCQ in the  specific situation of refractory APS still need to be fully clarified. Therefore,  this review summarizes the known modulating effects of HCQ and CQ, their side  effects and use in APS and different pathologies to understand the benefit  effects and the mechanism of action of HCQ in refractory obstetric APS.

T1  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in Children.
SP  - 1032-1040
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease, that mainly  affects skin, joints and kidneys but can affect any organ in the body. It is  characterized by presence of multiple autoantibodies like ANA, antibodies to  dsDNA and RNA associated proteins. The major mechanism leading to tissue damage  includes immune complex mediated complement activation, interferon alpha release  by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, NETosis by neutrophils as well as defects in  monocytes leading to poor clearance of cellular debris and direct cellular  dysfunction mediated by antibodies. A child can present with pyrexia of unknown  origin, immune mediated cytopenias, malar rash, oral ulcers, serositis,  glomerulonephritis or nervous system dysfunction. As renal disease has a bearing  on the long term impact, all children should have urine exam and blood pressure  measurement done to rule out renal disease. The treatment varies depending on the  severity and organs involved. In life or organ threatening situations, pulse  methylprednisolone is used. Hydroxychloroquine, Mycophenolate mofetil,  Azathioprine and Cyclophosphamide are the commonly used drugs in SLE. Over the  years the prognosis of SLE has improved probably due to early diagnosis and  better use of immunosuppressive treatment, regular follow up and treatment of  co-morbidities. The 10-year survival now approaches 90% and with advent of new  and targeted therapy it is hoped that the morbidity and organ damage can also be  minimized.

T1  - Biomarkers for systemic lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 39-58
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is complex autoimmune disease  with heterogenous manifestations, unpredictable disease course and response to  treatment. One of the critical needs in SLE management is the identification of  reliable biomarkers that can aid in early diagnosis, accurate monitoring of  disease activity, and assessment of treatment response. AREAS COVERED: In the  current review, we focus on the commonly affected organs (skin, kidney, and  nervous system) in SLE to summarize the emerging biomarkers that show promise in  disease diagnosis, monitoring and treatment response assessment. The subtitles  within each organ domain were determined based on the most relevant and promising  biomarkers for that specific organ damage. EXPERT OPINION: Biomarkers have the  potential to significantly benefit the management of SLE by aiding in diagnosis,  disease activity monitoring, prognosis, and treatment response assessment.  However, despite decades of research, none has been validated and implemented for  routine clinical use. Novel biomarkers could lead to the development of precision  medicine for SLE, guide personalized treatment, and improve patient outcomes.  Challenges in biomarker research in SLE include defining clear and clinically  relevant questions, accounting for the heterogeneity of SLE, and confirming  initial findings in larger, multi-center, multi-ethnic, independent cohorts that  reflect real-world clinical scenarios.

T1  - Survival and prognosis analysis of systemic lupus erythematosus patients with 
SP  - e34947
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study aimed to evaluate survival rates and prognosis in systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) using  meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane central register of controlled  trials, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Science and Technology  Journal Database, Wan-Fang Database, and Chinese biomedical database were  searched. Information and data were screened and extracted by 2 researchers. The  obtained data were analyzed using the R software meta package. Quality assessment  was conducted using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The causes of heterogeneity were  analyzed using subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Publication bias was  evaluated using Begger funnel plots and Egger test. RESULTS: The search strategy  yielded a total of 21 studies involving 875 patients included in the final  analysis. The pooled 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients with SLE-PH  were 0.9020 (95%CI: 0.8576; 0.9397), 0.8363 (96%CI: 0.7813; 0.8852), 0.7301  (95%CI: 0.6327; 0.8181). The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of echocardiography  subgroup were 0.9000 (95%CI: 0.8480; 0.9551), 0.8435 (95%CI: 0.7744; 0.9187),  0.6795 (95%CI: 0.5746; 0.8035), respectively; and there were 0.9174 (95%CI:  0.8951; 0.9402), 0.8529 (95%CI: 0.8255; 0.8812), 0.7757 (95%CI: 0.7409; 0.8121)  at right heart catheterization subgroup in the meantime. Multivariate analysis  for predicting mortality in SLE-PH patients revealed that diminishing left  ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association classification, lupus  nephritis, lower cardiac index, and higher red blood cell distribution width  level were significantly associated with a higher mortality rate. Treatment with  huge doses of cyclophosphamide, tricuspid annular plane systolic  excursion/pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and Raynaud phenomenon signaled  favorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of SLE-PH  patients in recent years (0.9020, 0.8363, 0.7301) were estimated in this study.  SLE-PH patients diagnosed by echocardiography have a worse long-term prognosis  than those diagnosed by right heart catheterization. Studies after 2015 have  shown significantly better survival than earlier studies.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of Janus kinase inhibitors in systemic and cutaneous lupus 
SP  - 103440
AB  - BACKGROUND: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been proven to be effective and  safe in various autoimmune diseases. However, there is still a lack of  comprehensive evidence regarding their efficacy and safety in systemic and  cutaneous lupus erythematosus. METHODS: We searched for systemic and cutaneous  lupus erythematosus patients who were treated with JAK inhibitors in PubMed,  Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library until February 28, 2023. The  quality of clinical trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.  Meta-analysis was conducted when at least three studies had comparable measures  of outcome. If meta-analysis was not feasible, a descriptive review was carried  out. RESULTS: We included 30 studies, consisting of 10 randomized controlled  trials and 20 case series or reports, with a total of 2,460 patients. JAK  inhibitors were found to be more effective than placebo in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) based on the percentage of achieving SLE Responder Index  (SRI)-4 response (RR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.31; p = 0.001), British Isles Lupus  Assessment Group -based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response (RR = 1.16;  95% CI 1.02 to 1.31; p = 0.02), Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS)  (RR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.54; p = 0.008), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2 K) remission of arthritis or rash  (RR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.18; p = 0.04), particularly in treating  musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous involvement. However, the effect of JAK  inhibitors on cutaneous lupus erythematosus was uncertain. JAK inhibitors and  placebo had a similar incidence of adverse events (RR = 1.01; 95% CI 0.97 to  1.04; p = 0.65). CONCLUSION: JAK inhibitors could be a potential treatment option  for systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, particularly in treating  cutaneous and musculoskeletal lesions of SLE. JAK inhibitors had a safe profile.

T1  - Is per-protocol kidney biopsy required in lupus nephritis?
SP  - 103422
AB  - Baseline kidney biopsy is recommended in lupus nephritis (LN). Biopsy allows to  classify different forms of LN and differentiate other forms of renal  involvement, such as tubulo-interstitial nephritis or thrombotic microangiopathy.  The indications for repeat biopsy are more controversial. Some authors feel that  good clinical monitoring is sufficient to assess prognosis and make therapeutic  decisions. Based on the recently demonstrated discordance between clinical and  histological response, some physicians recommend per-protocol biopsies either at  6 months in stable patients to verify the response to induction therapy, or after  one-to-two years to assess treatment efficacy and tune the duration of  maintenance therapy. Others recommend repeating kidney biopsy in case of  incomplete response or to discriminate between active and chronic lesions. By  definition, a per-protocol kidney biopsy differs from a repeat biopsy in that the  former is foreseen at fixed timepoints, regardless of the clinical response.  Although any decision should always consider the patient's overall clinical  condition, there are no doubts that repeat kidney biopsy represents a useful tool  in difficult cases to evaluate treatment response, modulate treatment intensity,  and predict long-term renal outcome both in quiescent lupus and during flares.  How to harmonize per-protocol biopsies in the LN course remains challenging.

T1  - Rice body synovitis in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1773-1779
AB  - Rice bodies (RBs) synovitis in the shoulder joints of systemic lupus  erythematosus patients is a rare clinical condition that has not been previously  reported. Despite the fact that the diagnosis of RBs synovitis has primarily  relied on MRI imaging, ultrasound has been used less frequently. In this report,  we discuss a 43-year-old female diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus who  presented with pain and swelling in the right shoulder. The ultrasound findings  were typical, and the patient was diagnosed with RBs synovitis, as she had no  history of tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Subsequently, the patient  underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy and surgical excision, which led  to a good postoperative outcome. Based on this case, a literature review of RBs  synovitis over the past 2 decades indicates that rice bodies synovitis is rare in  clinical presentation accompanied by SLE. Moreover, ultrasound has not been  extensively employed for diagnosing this condition. It is important to note the  pivotal role of ultrasound in detecting RBs synovitis, and it should be the  preferred method for early detection. Therefore, ultrasound physicians should be  well informed about this condition to enhance diagnostic precision.

T1  - Potential of bone morphogenetic protein-7 in treatment of lupus nephritis: 
SP  - 2161-2172
AB  - Up to 50% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients world-wide develop lupus  nephritis (LN). In low to middle income countries and in particular in  sub-Saharan Africa, where SLE is prevalent with a more aggressive course, LN and  end stage renal disease is a major cause of mortality. While developed countries  have the funding to invest in SLE and LN research, patients of African descent  are often underrepresented in clinical trials. Thus, the complex influence of  ethnicity and genetic background on outcome of LN and SLE as a whole, is not  fully understood. Several pathophysiological mechanisms including major role  players driving LN have been identified. A large body of literature suggest that  prevention of fibrosis-which contributes to chronicity of LN-may significantly  improve long-term prognosis. Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) was first  identified as a therapeutic option in this context decades ago and evidence of  its benefit in various conditions, including LN, is ever-increasing. Despite  these facts, BMP-7 is not being implemented as therapy in the context of renal  disease. With this review, we briefly summarise current understanding of LN  pathology and discuss the evidence in support of therapeutic potential of BMP-7  in this context. Lastly, we address the obstacles that need to be overcome,  before BMP-7 may become available as LN treatment.

T1  - Pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 101860
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease which  frequently affects women of childbearing age. Nowadays, pregnancy is not  contraindicated in cases of well-controlled disease activity, but pregnancies are  still at higher risk of maternal and fetal complications compared to the general  population. During pregnancy and puerperium patients are at risk of disease  flare, and obstetric complications are more frequent in cases of active disease  at conception/beginning of pregnancy, a history of lupus nephritis, and  concomitant presence of antiphospholipid syndrome. To improve pregnancy outcomes  in SLE patients, appropriate preconception counseling with changes in medication,  if necessary, and close rheumatological and obstetrical monitoring are  fundamental. This review aims to summarize the risk factors for adverse pregnancy  outcomes and provide an update on developments in medical care for pregnancy in  SLE patients.

T1  - Does baricitinib reduce disease activity in patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 579-589
AB  - Baricitinib is a selective Janus kinase inhibitor that has recently been approved  for treating certain autoimmune disorders. This meta-analysis pooled the  conflicting results from all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about  the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). We systemically searched four electronic databases. RCTs  comparing baricitinib versus placebo were included. Our outcomes were pooled as  the risk ratio (RR) in the random effects model. Our primary outcome was the  proportion of patients who achieved a SLE Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) response. A  total of three RCTs, comprising 1849 patients, were included. Baricitinib 4 mg  was associated with a significantly higher proportion of patients who attained  SRI-4 response at week 24 (RR = 1.19, 95% CI [1.05, 1.35], P < 0.01). However,  this did not reach statistical significance with baricitinib 4 mg at week 52 and  baricitinib 2 mg at both week 24 and week 52 (RR = 1.13, 95% CI [0.96, 1.34],  P = 0.15; RR = 1.09, 95% CI [0.96, 1.24], P = 0.20; RR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.92,  1.19], P = 0.50, respectively). The risk for serious infections was higher in the  baricitinib 4 mg group (RR = 2.23, 95% CI [1.13, 4.37], P = 0.02). Baricitinib 2  mg did not show any clinical benefit. In contrast, baricitinib 4 mg might have  the potential to reduce SLE disease activity; however, further research is  required to evaluate its long-term efficacy. Until higher-quality evidence is  developed, the benefits and risks of baricitinib should be considered before  initiating its therapy. Key Points * Baricitinib is a selective Janus kinase  inhibitor that has recently been approved for treating certain autoimmune  disorders; however, its efficacy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) is still inconclusive. * In our meta-analysis, baricitinib 2 mg did not  show any clinical benefit. In contrast, baricitinib 4 mg significantly reduced  SLE activity in terms of SRI-4 response at week 24. However, this did not reach  statistical significance at week 52. * Further studies are required to  investigate the long-term efficacy of baricitinib 4 mg in patients with SLE.

SP  - 1143-1154
AB  - Lupus nephritis is one of the most common and severe complications of systemic  lupus erythematosus and is also a major predictor of poor prognosis and  mortality. Lupus nephritis has the characteristics of insidious onset, complex  pathological types, rapid progression of organ damage, and easy recurrence.  Currently, kidney damage in lupus nephritis is usually assessed based on urine  analysis, renal biopsy, and glomerular filtration rates. However, they all have  certain limitations, making it difficult to diagnose lupus nephritis early and  assess its severity and progression. With the rapid development of functional  magnetic resonance, multiple functional imaging techniques are expected to  provide more useful information for the pathophysiological development, early  diagnosis, progression, prognosis, and renal function evaluation of lupus  nephritis. This article reviews the principle of multiple functional magnetic  resonance imaging and the research status of evaluating renal function in lupus  nephritis.

T1  - Multidisciplinary approach to lupus nephritis: Clinical pearls, pitfalls, and 
SP  - 1155-1163
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a major course of morbidity and mortality in patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), best managed by a multidisciplinary  group. To this end, we gathered a group of rheumatologists, nephrologists and a  nephropathologist to review current evidence regarding diagnosis and management  of LN. In this consensus paper, we summarize the key points from this meeting and  provide practice guidelines for the management of kidney involvement in SLE, in  view of emerging new data concerning novel agents approved recently. Renal biopsy  is indispensable for the management of LN. Yet, important pearls and pitfalls  need to be considered regarding indications and interpretation, which are  summarized in informative tables. In new-onset LN, experts agreed that, although  belimumab may be added from disease onset, patients with moderate to severe  proliferative nephritis (defined as: NIH activity index > 5 plus >/= 1 of the  following: (i) NIH chronicity index > 2, (ii) proteinuria > 3 g/24 h, and (iii)  increase in serum creatinine > 20%) may be more likely to benefit the most. In  all other patients who have already started standard-of-care treatment with  either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or cyclophosphamide (CY), belimumab could be  considered in cases with an inadequate clinical response by 3 months, or in cases  that experience a nephritic flare following initial response, or have an  inability to reduce the dose of glucocorticoids. In all circumstances, the drug  should be given as add-on therapy, that is, in combination with a  standard-of-care therapy (MMF or CY). Voclosporin could be considered for up to  3 years, in combination with MMF, in patients with heavy proteinuria (well above  the nephrotic range), wherein a quick reduction of protein loss in urine is  desirable to avoid the complications of the nephrotic syndrome, either as part of  the initial regimen, or in cases of inadequate reduction of proteinuria with MMF.  In view of the potential scarring effects, long-term administration beyond the  first year requires further documentation.

T1  - Transverse myelitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE-TM): A 
SP  - 1033-1042
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus-related transverse myelitis (SLE-TM) is a rare but  serious complication of SLE, which may result in significant morbidity. Its  incidence is estimated between 0.5% and 1% of all SLE patients but may be the  presenting feature in 30%-60% of these patients. Unfortunately, due to lack of  high-quality studies, data regarding this condition remains limited. Its  pathogenesis remains largely unknown and clinical presentation is variable. There  are still no set guidelines regarding diagnosis, management, or monitoring and  the role of autoantibodies remains controversial. In this review, we aim to  summarize the available data regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical  features, management, and prognosis of this rare disease.

SP  - 6-47
AB  - A significant number of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (between 20%  and 60% according to different reported series) develop lupus nephritis in the  course of its evolution, which directly influences their quality of life and  vital prognosis. In recent years, the greater knowledge about the pathogenesis of  systemic lupus and lupus nephritis has allowed relevant advances in the  diagnostic approach and treatment of these patients, achieving the development of  drugs specifically aimed at blocking key pathogenic pathways of the disease.  Encouragingly, these immunomodulatory agents have shown in well-powered,  randomized clinical trials good clinical efficacy in the medium-term, defined as  proteinuria remission and preservation of kidney function, with an acceptable  safety profile and good patient tolerability. All this has made it possible to  reduce the use of corticosteroids and other potentially more toxic therapies, as  well as to increase the use of combined therapies. The present consensus document  carried out by the Glomerular Diseases Working Group of the Spanish Society of  Nephrology (GLOSEN), collects in a practical and summarized, but rigorous way,  the best currently available evidence about the diagnosis, treatment, and  follow-up of lupus nephritis patients, including cases of special situations,  with the main objective of providing updated information and well-founded  clinical recommendations to treating physicians, to improve the diagnostic and  therapeutic approach to our patients.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of belimumab therapy in lupus nephritis: a systematic review 
SP  - 2207671
AB  - BACKGROUND: Belimumab is the first biological agent approved for the treatment of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the efficacy of belimumab for lupus  nephritis (LN) is not clear. We conducted this meta-analysis and systematic  review to compare the efficacy and safety of belimumab with those of conventional  therapy for LN. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov  were searched in 31 December 2022 to identify relevant adult human studies  reporting effectiveness outcomes of belimumab in patients with LN. Review manager  (RevMan 5.4) was used for data analysis with fixed effects model based on  heterogeneities. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included  in the quantitative analysis. A total of 2960 participants were identified.  Belimumab plus standard therapy significantly improved total renal response rates  (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.53; p = 0.001) and complete renal RRs (1.47; 95% CI,  1.07-2.02; p = 0.02) compared with the control plus standard therapy group. It  significantly reduced the risk of renal flare (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37-0.69;  p < 0.001) and renal function worsening or progression to end-stage renal disease  (ESRD) (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.79; p = 0.001). When assessed with the incidence  of adverse events, no significant differences between the two groups were  observed for the occurrence of treatment-related adverse events (RR, 1.04; 95%  CI, 0.99-1.09; p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that belimumab  plus standard therapy was more effective and had a favorable safety in patients  with LN.

T1  - Maternal and fetal outcomes of SLE in pregnancy: a literature review.
SP  - 2205513
AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an auto-immune disease in which the immune  system assaults its tissues. We aimed to analyse the maternal and foetal outcomes  during pregnancy in SLE mothers. A literature search was conducted by two  investigators to assess SLE's outcomes on maternal and foetal during pregnancies.  We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google scholar to collect evidence from  different research studies, draw the conclusion, and report it. In our  investigation, we found out that SLE could cause a spectrum of complications  during pregnancy, not only for the mother but also for the foetus. It could  affect fertility and cause difficult pregnancies for the couple as well which  includes certain complications such as: preterm labour and delivery, high blood  pressure (preeclampsia), placental insufficiency, miscarriage or stillbirth,  whereas in the foetus SLE can cause mortality, preterm birth, and neonatal lupus  (a temporary condition in the baby caused by SLE-related antibodies) and  structural abnormalities. The literature suggests that SLE could prove fatal for  the foetus and induce many complications in the mother. However, this could be  avoided if pregnancy is planned right from the start and proper management is  provided to the mother during pregnancy and delivery.p.

T1  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Immunogenicity of Anifrolumab.
SP  - 655-671
AB  - The type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis  of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anifrolumab is a monoclonal antibody that  targets the type I IFN receptor subunit 1. Anifrolumab is approved in several  countries for patients with moderate to severe SLE receiving standard therapy.  The approved dosing regimen of anifrolumab is a 300-mg dose administered  intravenously every 4 weeks; this was initially based on the results of the Phase  2b MUSE and further confirmed in the Phase 3 TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 trials, in which  anifrolumab 300-mg treatment was associated with clinically meaningful  improvements in disease activity with an acceptable safety profile. There have  been several published analyses of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  profile of anifrolumab, including a population-pharmacokinetic analysis of 5  clinical studies of healthy volunteers and patients with SLE, in which body  weight and type I IFN gene expression were significant covariates identified for  anifrolumab exposure and clearance. Additionally, the pooled Phase 3 SLE  population has been used to evaluate how serum exposure may be related to  clinical responses, safety risks, and pharmacodynamic effects of the 21-gene type  I IFN gene signature (21-IFNGS). The relevance of 21-IFNGS with regard to  clinical efficacy outcomes has also been analyzed. Herein, the clinical  pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of anifrolumab as well as  results of population-pharmacokinetics and exposure-response analyses are  reviewed.

T1  - Racial disparities in pregnancy outcomes among women with rheumatic diseases: A 
SP  - 152193
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a limited understanding of racial disparities in adverse  pregnancy outcomes (APO) among women with rheumatic diseases. The aim of our  study was to conduct a systematic literature review to evaluate the impact of  race on APO in women with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Databases were searched to  find reports of APO stratified by race among women with rheumatic diseases. The  initial searches were conducted in July 2020 and updated in March 2021. Of the  final included articles, the full text was reviewed, and data was extracted from  each study using a standard data abstraction form. RESULTS: Ten studies with a  total of 39,720 patients met our eligibility criteria. There was a greater  propensity for APO in racial minorities with rheumatic diseases compared to their  White counterparts. Among women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Black  women had the highest odds of APOs, particularly those with a concomitant  diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Pooled meta-analysis could not be done  due to multiple factors, including heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSION:  Racial minorities with rheumatic diseases are more prone to APO compared to their  White counterparts. One limitation is the lack of standardized criteria for APO,  which prohibited direct comparison between studies. There is also a paucity of  data looking at APOs among women with rheumatic diseases other than SLE. Further  research is needed to explore the drivers of these racial disparities to guide  targeted solutions for those in the greatest need.

T1  - Treatment of lupus nephritis: consensus, evidence and perspectives.
SP  - 227-238
AB  - Despite the continuing development of immunomodulatory agents and supportive  care, the prognosis associated with lupus nephritis (LN) has not improved  substantially in the past decade, with end-stage kidney disease still developing  in 5-30% of patients within 10 years of LN diagnosis. Moreover, inter-ethnic  variation in the tolerance of, clinical response to and level of evidence  regarding various therapeutic regimens for LN has led to variation in treatment  prioritization in different international recommendations. Modalities that better  preserve kidney function and reduce the toxicities of concomitant glucocorticoids  are unmet needs in the development of therapeutics for LN. In addition to the  conventional recommended therapies for LN, there are newly approved treatments as  well as investigational drugs in the pipeline, including the newer generation  calcineurin inhibitors and biologic agents. In view of the heterogeneity of LN in  terms of clinical presentation and prognosis, the choice of therapies depends on  a number of clinical considerations. Molecular profiling, gene-signature  fingerprints and urine proteomic panels might enhance the accuracy of patient  stratification for treatment personalization in the future.

T1  - Current state and completeness of reporting clinical prediction models using 
SP  - 103294
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We carried out a systematic review (SR) of adherence in diagnostic and  prognostic applications of ML in SLE using the Transparent Reporting of a  multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD)  Statement. METHODS: A SR employing five databases was conducted from its  inception until December 2021. We identified articles that evaluated the  utilization of ML for prognostic and/or diagnostic purposes. This SR was reported  based on the PRISMA guidelines. The TRIPOD statement assessed adherence to  reporting standards. Assessment for risk of bias was done using PROBAST tool.  RESULTS: We included 45 studies: 29 (64.4%) diagnostic and 16 (35.5%) prognostic  prediction- model studies. Overall, articles adhered by between 17% and 67%  (median 43%, IQR 37-49%) to TRIPOD items. Only few articles reported the model's  predictive performance (2.3%, 95% CI 0.06-12.0), testing of interaction terms  (2.3%, 95% CI 0.06-12.0), flow of participants (50%, 95% CI; 34.6-65.4), blinding  of predictors (2.3%, 95% CI 0.06-12.0), handling of missing data (36.4%, 95% CI  22.4-52.2), and appropriate title (20.5%, 95% CI 9.8-35.3). Some items were  almost completely reported: the source of data (88.6%, 95% CI 75.4-96.2),  eligibility criteria (86.4%, 95% CI 76.2-96.5), and interpretation of findings  (88.6%, 95% CI 75.4-96.2). In addition, most of model studies had high risk of  bias. CONCLUSIONS: The reporting adherence of ML-based model developed for SLE,  is currently inadequate. Several items deemed crucial for transparent reporting  were not fully reported in studies on ML-based prediction models. REVIEW  REGISTRATION: PROSPERO ID# CRD42021284881.

T1  - A systematic review of the incidence, management and prognosis of new-onset 
SP  - 1221-1243
AB  - A literature review on new-onset autoimmune connective tissue diseases (ACTDs)  following COVID-19 is lacking. We evaluated potential associations between  COVID-19 and the development of new-onset ACTDs. The "population" was adults with  disease terms for ACTDs, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's  syndrome, systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM),  anti-synthetase syndrome, mixed CTD and undifferentiated CTD, and "intervention"  as COVID-19 and related terms. Databases were searched for English-language  articles published until September 2022. We identified 2236 articles with 28  ultimately included. Of the 28 included patients, 64.3% were female, with a mean  age was 51.1 years. The USA reported the most cases (9/28). ACTD diagnoses  comprised: 11 (39.3%) IIM (including four dermatomyositis); 7 (25%) SLE; four  (14.3%) anti-synthetase syndrome; four (14.3%) SSc; two (7.1%) other ACTD (one  lupus/MCTD overlap). Of eight, four (14.3%) patients (including that with  lupus/MCTD) had lupus nephritis. The average time from COVID-19 to ACTD diagnosis  was 23.7 days. A third of patients were admitted to critical care, one for  treatment of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in SLE (14 sessions of  plasmapheresis, rituximab and intravenous corticosteroids) and nine due to  COVID-19. 80% of patients went into remission of ACTD following treatment, while  three (10%) patients died-one due to macrophage activation syndrome with  anti-synthetase syndrome and two from unreported causes. Our results suggest a  potential association between COVID-19 and new-onset ACTDs, notably in young  females, reflecting more comprehensive CTD epidemiology. The most common  diagnosis in our cohort was IIM. The aetiology and mechanisms by which ACTDs  emerge following COVID-19 remain unknown and require further research.

T1  - [Lupus nephritis: from diagnosis to treatment].
SP  - 225-233
AB  - Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), so-called lupus  nephritis (LN), is one of the most frequent organ manifestations with an  incidence of approximately 40-60%. It is not uncommon for renal involvement to be  the initial manifestation of SLE or to occur in the first 5-10 years after  diagnosis of SLE. Urinalysis is useful in screening for the presence of LN,  demonstrating proteinuria or active sediment with acanthocytes. Histologic  confirmation of LN, and thus the LN class present, is currently the gold standard  for confirming the diagnosis. In addition, knowledge of the LN class is  a relevant component of adequate treatment planning in SLE patients with LN. In  particular, early diagnosis and rapid response to therapy are of prognostic  importance for the preservation of renal function as well as morbidity and  mortality of the mostly young patients at the time of initial diagnosis. Thus,  the focus of therapy is to achieve complete remission, as well as to avoid active  disease phases. Due to a complex pathogenesis and at the same time a very  heterogeneous clinical presentation, with six different histological classes of  LN, there are different therapeutic targets. This in turn results in  a significant expansion of the study landscape in the field of LN with an  increasing understanding of the signaling pathways and influencing factors, and  fortunately in a growing armamentarium of available targeted therapy options.  Simultaneously, new insights into drug therapy to inhibit progression of chronic  renal disease are opening up supportive therapy options that can further improve  preservation of renal function.

T1  - Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Identification and Pharmacological 
SP  - 117-134
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by an aberrant immune  response, leading to an extremely heterogeneous clinical presentation,  potentially affecting different systems and organs. Despite the fact that SLE  mortality has greatly decreased since the introduction of steroids, some forms of  refractory/severe SLE still have the potential to result in permanent organ  damage as well as increased mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, SLE patients  with multiple comorbidities may face a clinical conundrum and have a bad  prognosis. An improved prognosis for severe refractory SLE depends on prompt and  appropriate treatment. Due to the scarcity of solid data from a  well-characterized group of patients with refractory/severe SLE coming from  randomized controlled studies, this review aims to shed light on this with  real-world evidence from clinical research performed at our Unit, the University  Center of Excellence on Nephrologic, Rheumatologic and Rare Diseases with  Nephrology and Dialysis Unit and Center of Immuno-Rheumatology and Rare Diseases  (CMID) (Turin, Italy). In order to determine the key clinical and prognostic  features, and therapeutic approaches for severe and/or refractory SLE, our  experience will be described together with existing literature, primarily focused  on dermatological, neuropsychiatric, and renal symptoms.

T1  - The lupus nephritis classification: lost in translation.
SP  - 199-203
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The ISN/RPS lupus nephritis classification is in the process  of undergoing a revision. It has lost its way and morphed from a classification  based on pathophysiology of disease into a staging system based on the extent of  spread and prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: There are multiple different  pathophysiologic processes that contribute to lupus nephritis. The current  classification is inadequate, as it does not highlight these differences and thus  squanders the opportunity to develop targeted therapies. Its focus is on the  extent of disease as opposed to the pattern of injury, which defines the disease.  To delineate the cause, we must include immunofluorescent and electron  microscopy, which will help define the pattern of injury. SUMMARY: To determine  eventual targeted treatments for lupus nephritis, we must first classify the  disease according to the available pathophysiologic mechanisms. In the upcoming  revision, including the immunofluorescence and electron microscopy and  eliminating the overemphasis on extent of disease are the first steps to  categorizing the lupus nephritis classes accurately.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of tacrolimus versus mycophenolate mofetil as induction 
SP  - 754-762
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of  tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as induction therapy and low-dose  tacrolimus as treatment for lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: Meta-analysis of  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to compare the efficacy and  safety of tacrolimus and MMF as induction therapy for LN. We systematically  reviewed RCTs and prospective cohort studies with a tacrolimus dose of 3 mg daily  and performed a meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus as an  induction treatment for LN in comparison to MMF. RESULTS: The inclusion criteria  were satisfied by eight studies (five RCTs and three prospective cohort studies)  with a total of 408 individuals (289 for tacrolimus vs. MMF and 119 for low-dose  tacrolimus). Tacrolimus and MMF had similar complete remission rates (odds ratio  [OR] 1.028; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.589-1.796; p = 0.922). The partial  remission rate did not differ between the tacrolimus and MMF groups (OR 1.400;  95% CI 0.741-2.646; p = 0.300). Tacrolimus and MMF showed no differences in  proteinuria, serum albumin, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, renal  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), or extra-renal  SLEDAI. The incidence of infection, severe infection, leukopenia, and  hyperglycemia did not differ between the tacrolimus and MMF groups. However,  herpes zoster infection was significantly less common in the tacrolimus group (OR  0.137; 95% CI 0.034-0.546; p = 0.005), whereas serum creatinine elevation was  significantly higher in the tacrolimus group than in the MMF group (OR 8.148; 95%  CI 1.369-48.50; p = 0.021). At 3 mg/d, tacrolimus was shown to be safe, well  tolerated, and offered therapeutic benefits in all investigations. CONCLUSION:  Tacrolimus was comparable to MMF in terms of effectiveness and safety as an  induction therapy for LN, with the exception of a reduced risk of herpes zoster  infection and a rise in serum creatinine. In individuals with LN, 3 mg/d  tacrolimus was proven to be efficacious and safe.

T1  - The effectiveness and safety of total glucosides of paeony in systemic lupus 
SP  - e32029
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of total glucosides of paeony in  the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: From the creation  of the database to July 2021, multiple databases were searched for randomized  controlled trials of treating SLE with total glucosides of paeony (TGP) combining  chemical medicine. After screening, quality evaluation and data extraction, the  included studies were analyzed by Revman5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of 11  studies were included, including 836 patients (treatment group 417, control group  419). Meta analysis showed that on the basis of routine treatment, TGP could  further improve the treatment effective rate (OR = 4.19, 95% CI: 2.21 to 7.95,  Z = 4.38, P < .0001), reduced SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) (MD = -1.70,  95%CI: -2.51 to -0.89, Z = 4.11, P < .0001) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate  (MD = -7.04, 95%CI: -8.48 to -5.59, Z = 9.53, P < .00001), reduced the level of  immunoglobulin A (IgA) (MD = -0.60, 95%CI: -0.82 to -0.37, Z = 5.24, P < .00001),  immunoglobulin G (IgG) (MD = -2.97, 95%CI: -3.72 to -2.23, Z = 7.82, P < .00001),  and immunoglobulin M (IgM) (MD = -0.36, 95%CI: -0.45 to -0.27, Z = 7.54,  P < .00001), increased the level of complement C3 (MD = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.30 to  0.39, Z = 14.40, P < .00001) and complement C4 (MD = 0.07, 95%CI: 0.06 to 0.08,  Z = 10.08, P < .00001), and decreased the recurrence (OR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.16 to  0.61, Z = 3.39, P = .0007), and there was no significant difference in the  incidence of adverse reactions (OR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.45 to 1.91, Z = 0.20,  P = .84). CONCLUSION: On the basis of conventional treatment, the combined use of  TGP can enhance the clinical efficacy of SLE without increasing the incidence of  adverse effects.

T1  - Improvement in Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus After Twenty Weeks of Belimumab Use: 
SP  - 1838-1848
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), with or without systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), can be debilitating and cause psychological distress.  Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits B cell activation, is a Federal  Drug Administration-approved SLE medication, but less is known on its use in CLE.  Moreover, the time to response after starting belimumab in CLE is unknown, which  may lead to premature discontinuation in the absence of early perceivable  benefits. Thus, the objectives of this meta-analysis were to examine the efficacy  of belimumab, as well as the time to response after starting belimumab in  patients with CLE with or without SLE. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search  was performed to include studies that examined clinical response in patients with  CLE with or without SLE receiving belimumab. A clinical response at 52 weeks in  belimumab users versus nonusers was summarized in a random-effects model.  Additionally, we calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) for each consecutive  4-week observation interval to identify time to a clinical response in CLE with  or without SLE after starting belimumab. RESULTS: Among 747 screened studies, 14  were included. The pooled odds of clinical response at 52 weeks in belimumab  users were 44% higher compared to nonusers (OR 1.44 [95% confidence interval (95%  CI) 1.20-1.74], I(2)  = 0%). A clinical response was first noted after 20 weeks  of starting belimumab (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.01-1.81], I(2)  = 0%), with a sustained  clinical response through 1 year. CONCLUSION: The findings support belimumab as  an effective therapy for CLE with SLE. Likewise, the findings inform patient  counseling regarding estimates of 20 weeks to achieve a response.

T1  - Update on Novel Blood-Based Biomarkers for Lupus Nephritis Beyond Diagnostic 
SP  - 227-231
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease  with a wide range of clinical presentations. Lupus nephritis (LN) is a frequent  complication of SLE, representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality  in these patients. In addition, LN diagnosis remains suboptimal in most clinical  contexts. The current gold standard for LN clinical diagnosis is a renal biopsy.  Still, the invasiveness of this technique is an obstacle to the early detection  of renal involvement and further monitoring of treatment results. Consequently,  there are different areas for improvement in the field of LN, such as the search  for novel non-invasive clinical biomarkers with an adequate correlation between  clinical manifestations and actual histological damage. Although urine  component-related studies are promising, the more robust blood/serum biomarkers  may still be helpful in developing point-of-care systems that can be adapted to  most clinical scenarios. Therefore, this brief review aims to highlight and  summarize some of the most recently reported non-classical serum/blood potential  LN biomarkers. (Rev Invest Clin. 2022;74(5):227-31).

SP  - 1020891
AB  - The diagnosis and differential classification of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) is difficult, especially in patients with early-onset SLE who are  susceptible to systemic multi-organ damage and serious complications and have  difficulties in individualized treatment. At present, diagnosis is based mainly  on clinical manifestations and the detection of serological antinuclear  antibodies. The pathogenesis of SLE involves multiple factors, is clinically  heterogeneous, and lacks specific biomarkers. Therefore, it is necessary to  identify new biomarkers for the diagnosis and subtype classification of SLE.  Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are composed of microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, small  nucleolar RNAs, circular RNAs, and transfer RNAs. They play an important role in  the occurrence and development of diseases and are used widely in the early  diagnosis and prognosis of autoimmune diseases. In this review, we focus on the  research progress in the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of SLE using humoral  to tissue level ncRNAs.

T1  - Placental damage in pregnancies with systemic lupus erythematosus: A narrative 
SP  - 941586
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease  of unknown cause, which mainly affects women of childbearing age, especially  between 15 and 55 years of age. During pregnancy, SLE is associated with a high  risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Among the most frequent complications  are spontaneous abortion, fetal death, prematurity, intrauterine Fetal growth  restriction (FGR), and preeclampsia (PE). The pathophysiology underlying  obstetric mortality and morbidity in SLE is still under investigation, but  several studies in recent years have suggested that placental dysfunction may  play a crucial role. Understanding this association will contribute to developing  therapeutic options and improving patient management thus reducing the occurrence  of adverse pregnancy outcomes in this group of women. In this review, we will  focus on the relationship between SLE and placental insufficiency leading to  adverse pregnancy outcomes.

T1  - Upfront rituximab therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in systemic 
SP  - 373-381
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by the  production of various autoantibodies and deposition of immune complexes on  tissues. Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening  hematological disorder that rarely develops in SLE, mainly caused by inhibitory  or clearing autoantibody against ADAMTS13. Although B cells play critical roles  in the pathogenesis of two diseases, the role of B-cell depletion therapy using  rituximab (RTX), a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, in the management  of TTP associated with SLE remains unclear. We present a 27-year-old woman who  manifested TTP and nephritis simultaneously at diagnosis of SLE. This patient  successfully responded to high-dose glucocorticoids combined with plasma  exchange, and early administration of RTX-induced sustained remission of TTP  without relapse over 16 months. This literature review in light of our case  demonstrates relationship between early intervention with RTX and better  treatment response despite the degree of ADAMTS13 activity. Moreover, we discuss  the clinical features in TTP associated with SLE, risk factors for the  development of TTP in SLE, and possible outcomes based on RTX dose. It is  important to consider upfront RTX as a promising treatment strategy for  SLE-associated secondary TTP to improve short-term response and long-term  prognosis.

T1  - Risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes prior to the onset of an autoimmune rheumatic 
SP  - 497-511
AB  - OBJECTIVES: An increased risk of adverse maternal and foetal pregnancy  complications (including pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and  small for gestational age) is well described in women with autoimmune rheumatic  disease (ARD) compared with the general population (GenPop). It is less clear,  however, whether this risk of adverse pregnancy outcome (APO) also exists in  women with 'preclinical ARD' (pre-ARD) before they are diagnosed with an ARD many  years post-partum. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic review of the  available evidence on APO in patients who subsequently were diagnosed with a  rheumatic disease to identify whether there is an increased risk in pre-ARD.  METHODS: The present study was reported in accordance with the guidance of the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  standard. A systematic literature review was performed using the online PubMed  database. Pre-SLE and pre-RA patients were defined as those who, over the  subsequent years, developed SLE or RA according to international classification  criteria. RESULTS: A total of 176 articles were screened, and 27 original  articles were selected for final analysis. Pre-RA was the most studied group,  with 15 studies and a total of >1600 pregnancies, and pre-SLE was the second-most  studied pre-ARD in pregnancy, with 14 studies and a total of >1000 pregnancies.  We found that patients who subsequently developed SLE had an increased burden of  poor pregnancy outcomes compared with pregnant women from the GenPop, but fewer  APOs compared with pregnancies of women with SLE. In contrast, a similar rate of  APOs was found when pre-RA pregnancies were compared with GenPop pregnancies.  CONCLUSION: Our findings of an increased risk of APO in certain pre-ARDs  highlights the relevance of taking an obstetric history during the first  rheumatology appointment and the need for novel screening strategies for the  prediction of APOs. Further research is required to elucidate the immune basis of  APOs in preclinical and clinical ARD.

T1  - Pregnancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review.
SP  - 63-71
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-a most common disorder in women of  reproductive age-has been described to be associated with adverse pregnancy  outcomes. Despite the increased health risks for the mother (preeclampsia, lupus  flare, arterial hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus and thrombotic risk  when antiphospholipid antibodies are present) and fetus (miscarriage, stillbirth,  premature birth, intrauterine growth restriction and neonatal lupus), the  majority of patients can deliver healthy neonates. With appropriate management by  a multidisciplinary team, composing rheumatologists, obstetricians and  neonatologists, women with SLE can achieve better pregnancy outcomes by  monitoring associated predictive indicators, raising major concern for severe  complications and somewhat early delivery if necessary. In this review, we  summarize the latest advances in secondary infertility and pregnancy-related risk  perception for lupus patients, with an emphasis on the safety of biological  agents (mainly belimumab and rituximab) and traditional therapeutic regimens.

T1  - Pregnancy-related complications in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 102864
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease  that predominantly affects women of childbearing age and results in various  adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). Pregnancy was formerly discouraged in patients  with SLE because of unstable disease activity during the gestation period,  increased thrombosis risk, severe organ damage, and inevitable side effects of  immunosuppressive agents. Currently, most patients with SLE have successful  pregnancies due to preconception counselling, strict monitoring, and improved  therapy with minimised complications for both the mother and foetus.  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is extensively used and is beneficial for improving  pregnancy outcomes. However, pregnant women with SLE have a high-risk of APOs,  such as disease flare, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),  preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss. Better understanding of the changes in maternal  immunity and serum biomarkers, as well as their relationships with SLE-related  APOs progression, would facilitate the investigation of molecular mechanisms for  triggering and ameliorating APOs. Furthermore, it would enable us to explore and  develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies to prevent disease activation.  Therefore, this review briefly introduces the interaction between pregnancy  outcomes and SLE, elucidates pathophysiological and immunological changes during  SLE pregnancy. Furthermore, this review systematically expounds on the effective  predictors of APOs and the molecular mechanisms underlying the SLE-related APOs  to provide a solid foundation for the advanced management of lupus pregnancy.

T1  - Use of belimumab in real-world in Spain: a scoping review about characteristics 
SP  - 3373-3382
AB  - BACKGROUND: Belimumab was the first biological drug approved for Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus (SLE). There is not a review focusing on all real-life experience  with belimumab to date that could help to describe how this drug behaves in the  Spanish clinical setting. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of SLE  patients treated with belimumab added to standard of care in real-clinical  setting in Spain. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive scoping review of  real-world data (RWD) according to PRISMA Scoping Reviews Checklist and the  framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley. PubMed and EMBASE were searched  without language restriction and hand searches of relevant articles were  examined. RESULTS: We included data from 222 patients treated with belimumab for  SLE included in 19 RWD studies conducted in Spain. The mean age was 40.9 years,  84.2% were female, and baseline scores SELENA-SLEDAI ranged between 5.9 and 12.  Lupus nephritis basal prevalence was of 2.7%. The main reason for belimumab  initiation was previous treatments lack of efficacy (69.7%) and the most common  laboratory abnormalities were hypocomplementemia (40.9%), ANA + (34.2%), and  anti-DNA (33.3%). The addition of belimumab to standard therapy was associated  with a reduction of daily glucocorticoids intake in 1.4-11.1 mg at 6 months.  Belimumab discontinuation was observed in 18.6% of patients. CONCLUSION: Our  study helps to further explore the profile of SLE patients most likely to be  treated with belimumab.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric manifestations in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 571-581
AB  - Neuropsychiatric manifestations occur frequently and are challenging to diagnose  in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most patients with  childhood-onset SLE have neuropsychiatric events in the first 2 years of disease.  30-70% of patients present with more than one neuropsychiatric event during their  disease course, with an average of 2-3 events per person. These symptoms are  associated with disability and mortality. Serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and  neuroimaging findings have been described in childhood-onset SLE; however, only a  few have been validated as biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring response to  treatment, or prognosis. The aim of this Review is to describe the genetic risk,  clinical and neuroimaging characteristics, and current treatment strategies of  neuropsychiatric manifestations in childhood-onset SLE.

T1  - Belimumab for systemic lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 2072143
AB  - In recent years, advances in the treatment and management of patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have improved their life expectancy and  quality of life. However, lupus nephritis (LN) still represents a major  life-threatening complication of the disease. Belimumab (BEL), a fully human  monoclonal IgG1lambda antibody neutralizing soluble B cell activating factor, was  approved more than ten years ago as add-on therapy in adults and pediatric  patients with a highly active, autoantibody-positive disease despite standard of  care (SoC). Recently, the superiority of the addition of BEL to SoC was also  demonstrated in LN. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the  study landscape, available therapeutic options for SLE (focusing on BEL in renal  and non-renal SLE), and new perspectives in the treatment field of this disease.  A personalized treatment approach will likely become available with the advent of  novel therapeutic agents for SLE and LN.

T1  - Indirect treatment comparison of anifrolumab efficacy versus belimumab in adults 
SP  - 765-777
AB  - Aim: Assess the comparative efficacy of anifrolumab 300 mg versus belimumab  10 mg/kg in adults with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  receiving standard therapy. Patients and methods: Population-adjusted simulated  treatment comparisons (primary analyses) and matching-adjusted indirect  comparisons (supporting analyses) were conducted using individual patient data  from TULIP-1/TULIP-2 and summary-level data from BLISS-52/BLISS-76. Results:  Compared with belimumab-treated patients, anifrolumab-treated patients were more  than twice as likely to achieve a reduction of four or more points in SLE Disease  Activity Index 2000 score (simulated treatment comparison odds ratio: 2.47; 95%  CI: 1.16-5.25) and SLE Responder Index-4 response (odds ratio: 2.61; 95% CI:  1.22-5.58) at 52 weeks. Conclusion: Patients with moderate-to-severe SLE are more  likely to achieve an improvement in disease activity with anifrolumab than with  belimumab.

T1  - Transverse myelitis in systemic lupus erythematosus: A case report and systematic 
SP  - 103103
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare complication secondary to  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can cause patients' extensive and severe  neuropsychiatric disorders. Due to the rarity of the onset of acute TM, there is  still no standard treatment protocol. This study was to summarize the clinical  features of SLE-TM through a case report and systematic review. METHODS: We  report a case of acute TM with the initial symptoms of headache and fever on  admission to hospital, with lesions in medulla oblongata, cervical medulla, and  thoracic medulla. Furthermore, all cases of SLE combined with acute TM from  January 1975 to February 2022 were concluded and reviewed to compare the  disease's current treatment strategies and prognosis. RESULTS: Patients with  SLE-TM are mainly female (97.65%), with an average age of 36.89, a TM incidence  of 24.51% and a longitudinal myelitis (LM) incidence of 67.76%. In addition,  68.63% of patients present an increased albumin, and only 16.50% of patients  could recover. 32.35% of patients showed positive anti-cardiolipin antibody.  Moreover, the patients who could recover are generally younger than those in the  improved and paraparesis groups. After classifying the statistical results twice  according to magnetic resonance imaging results and prognosis respectively, the  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in LM group was significantly higher than  that in the other two groups. The positive rate of anti-DNA and anti-cardiolipin  antibody (ANCL) in TM group was significantly higher than that of the other  groups. According to the prognostic grouping, ESR in the recovery group was  significantly higher than those in the other two groups. The positive ANCL in the  poor prognosis group was slightly higher than that in the other two groups.  CONCLUSION: We offer a novel insight for this rare disease and hope to bring some  inspiration the basic research for SLE-TM.

T1  - Comparative Effectiveness of Rituximab and Common Induction Therapies for Lupus 
SP  - 859380
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety (infection events)  between rituximab (RTX), tacrolimus (TAC), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and  cyclophosphamide (CYC) as induction therapies in lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS:  Electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, were  searched from inception up to December 9, 2021. Bayesian network meta-analysis  was used to combine the direct and indirect evidence of different drugs for LN  patients. The pooled relative effects were shown using odds ratios (ORs) and 95%  credible intervals (CrIs). RESULTS: Nineteen studies (1,566 patients) met the  inclusion criteria and were selected in the present study. The network  meta-analysis reported that no statistically significant differences were found  in partial remission (PR) and infection among the four drugs. RTX showed a  significantly higher complete remission (CR) than MMF (OR = 2.60, 95% CrI =  1.00-7.10) and seemed to be more effective than CYC (OR = 4.20, 95% CrI =  1.70-14.00). MMF had a better CR than CYC (OR = 1.60, 95% CrI = 1.00-3.20). TAC  presented a better overall response than CYC (OR = 3.70, 95% CrI = 1.20-12.00).  Regarding CR and overall response, the maximum surface under the cumulative  ranking curve (SUCRA) values were 96.94% for RTX and 80.15% for TAC. The maximum  SUCRA value of infection reaction was 74.98% for RTX and the minimum value was  30.17% for TAC, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RTX and TAC were the most effective  drugs for induction remission in LN. Among the four drugs, TAC had the lowest  probability of infection, and RTX showed the highest probability of experiencing  an infection. This meta-analysis could not conclude about other adverse events.

T1  - Impact of Belimumab on Organ Damage in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 1822-1828
AB  - Organ damage is a key determinant of poor long-term prognosis and early death in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prevention of damage is a key  treatment goal of the 2019 update of the European Alliance of Associations for  Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations for SLE management. Belimumab is a  monoclonal antibody that inhibits B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and is the only  therapy approved for both SLE and lupus nephritis. Here, we review the clinical  trial and real-world data on the effects of belimumab on organ damage in adult  patients with SLE. Across 4 phase III studies, belimumab in combination with  background SLE therapy demonstrated consistent reductions in key drivers of organ  damage including disease activity, risk of new severe flares, and glucocorticoid  exposure compared to background therapy alone. Long-term belimumab use in SLE  also reduced organ damage progression measured by the Systemic Lupus  International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage  Index, as reported in open-label extension studies, and propensity score-matched  comparative analyses to background therapy alone. Results from a clinical trial  showed that in patients with active lupus nephritis, belimumab treatment improved  renal response, reduced the risk of renal-related events, and impacted features  related to kidney damage progression compared to background therapy alone. The  decrease of organ damage accumulation observed with belimumab treatment in SLE,  including lupus nephritis, suggest a disease-modifying effect.

T1  - Treatment with low-dose prednisone in refractory obstetric antiphospholipid 
SP  - 808-819
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids have been suggested as a potential therapy in  refractory obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (oAPS). Our aims were to describe  a cohort of patients with oAPS treated with low-dose glucocorticoids and to  perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of  additional glucocorticoids on the pregnancy outcomes in oAPS patients. METHODS:  Retrospective study that included 11 women diagnosed with primary  antiphospholipid syndrome. The meta-analysis was conducted by fitting random  effects models and was checked for heterogeneity. RESULTS: All women had suffered  from early pregnancy losses and two also had a history of fetal deaths. We  studied 47 pregnancies that resulted in 32 abortions (68.1%) and 3 fetal deaths  (6.4%). Twenty-six pregnancies were under treatment, mainly LDA and LMWH.  Low-dose glucocorticoids were indicated in 13 pregnancies (always in association  with LDA and LMWH). There was a decrease in pregnancy loss in those patients  treated with LDA and LMWH. Treatment with glucocorticoids significantly increased  the rate of successful pregnancy (38.5% abortions in treated vs 85.3% abortions  in non-treated pregnancies; p=0.003). After multivariate GEE analysis, only  glucocorticoids remained inversely associated with pregnancy loss (OR=0.157, (CI  0.025-0.968, p=0.046)). The meta-analysis showed that glucocorticoids tended to  improve the frequency of successful pregnancy (OR= 0.509 (0.252-1.028), p=0.06).  Three cases of gestational diabetes and one of preeclampsia were observed in our  cohort. The meta-analysis, which mostly included studies using high-dose  steroids, showed that glucocorticoids increased not only the frequency of  preeclampsia and gestational diabetes, but also the rate of pre-term birth.  CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of low-dose glucocorticoids in addition to the standard  therapy in patients with refractory oAPS should be confirmed in well-designed  clinical trials. However, high doses of steroids significantly increase the  frequency of maternal and fetal morbidities, making their use strongly  inadvisable.

T1  - Pregnancy and Management in Women with Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 523-535
AB  - Management of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) during pregnancy presents  unique clinical challenges. Women with both RA and SLE can have disease flares  during pregnancy, leading to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia,  small-for-gestational-age infants, and preterm delivery. Disease should be under  control prior to conception. Women with obstetric APS need to be anticoagulated  during pregnancy. Many but not all antirheumatic medications can be used during  pregnancy and lactation.

T1  - Rheumatic Diseases in Reproductive Age-the Possibilities and the Risks.
SP  - 111-123
AB  - The most common systemic connective tissue diseases (CTD), such as rheumatoid  arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid syndrome  (APS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), affect many women  of reproductive age. These diseases may strongly impact the course of pregnancy  and increase the risk factors of incompatibility. A literature search was done on  MEDLINE, PubMed, and Google Scholar in 2011-2021. The analysis included  meta-analysis, randomized control trials, prospective and retrospective studies,  and systematic reviews. The literature search allowed us to form conclusions and  underline recommendations regarding pregnancy's risk and treatment possibilities  in the course of rheumatic disease. Optimal control of CTD activity should be  reached at least 6 months before conception. High-risk pregnancies are often  accompanied by maternal-placental syndrome, which manifests as preeclampsia,  eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and prematurity. The flare of rheumatic  disease can coexist with obstetrical complications, and differential diagnosis  can be difficult. Medications that do not influence the risk of fetus  complications should be applied before and during pregnancy. Teratogenic drugs  (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide) must be withdrawn before  pregnancy. Conventional medications such as hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine,  colchicine, and the TNFalpha inhibitor certolizumab can be used safely at any stage  of pregnancy. Corticosteroids should be tapered, and other biologics should be  avoided due to teratogenicity or carefully administered due to the impact on the  fetal immune system. Distinguishing between disease flare and obstetrical  complications can be difficult in clinical practice; however, some clinical  symptoms and serological markers can be helpful in the differential diagnosis.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of belimumab therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus: A 
SP  - 666-673
AB  - BACKGROUND: Belimumab is the first biological agent approved for the treatment of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The efficacy and safety of belimumab for SLE  patients are not clear. Therefore, this meta-analysis is integrating the efficacy  and safety of belimumab for patients with SLE. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and  Cochrane Library were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that studied  the efficacy and safety of belimumab plus standard therapy before November 1,  2021. Data were pooled using the random-effects model and are expressed as risk  ratios (RRs) or mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals  (CIs). Heterogeneity was assessed and quantified using I(2). RESULTS: Seven RCTs  with 3,009 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Belimumab showed  significantly decreased at least a 4-point improvement in Safety of Estrogen in  Lupus National Assessment (SELENA)-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity  Index (SLEDAI) score than placebo (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.21-1.44; p < 0.001).  However, belimumab significantly reduced the prednisone dose by 50% or more than  placebo (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.17-2.15; p = 0.003) and belimumab significantly  increased the 36 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score (MD, 1.60; 95% CI,  0.30-2.90; p = 0.02). Regarding adverse events, there was no significant  difference between the belimumab group and the control group. CONCLUSION: The  results suggest that belimumab plus standard therapy is more effective than  placebo plus standard therapy in SLE patients.

SP  - 278-282
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Renal involvement in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus can lead to significant complications including end-stage renal  disease. Treatment of lupus nephritis has evolved over the last several decades,  but despite this evolution, many patients fail to achieve remission and often  progress to end-stage kidney disease or carry a burden of adverse side effects  related to treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent findings from AURORA 1 and  BLISS LN trials led the FDA to approve voclosporin and belimumab for the  treatment of lupus nephritis. The AURORA 1 trial demonstrated that voclosporin, a  second-generation calcineurin inhibitor, effectively lowers proteinuria in  patients with lupus nephritis, when added to mycophenolate mofetil with a better  safety profile, compared with other calcineurin inhibitors. The BLISS LN trial  revealed better control of disease and lower risk of progression to end stage  kidney disease (ESKD) and relapses in patients treated with belimumab in addition  to standard therapy. SUMMARY: Both voclosporin and belimumab are costly and have  not shown any early evidence to revolutionize practice in the management of lupus  nephritis. Until more data are made available with future studies or other  cost-effective treatment options become available, the widespread adoption and  utility of these novel agents remains limited.

T1  - Emerging Molecular Markers Towards Potential Diagnostic Panels for Lupus.
SP  - 808839
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease which  can affect various tissues and organs, posing significant challenges for clinical  diagnosis and treatment. The etiology of SLE is highly complex with contributions  from environmental factors, stochastic factors as well as genetic susceptibility.  The current criteria for diagnosing SLE is based primarily on a combination of  clinical presentations and traditional lab testing. However, these tests have  suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. They are unable to indicate disease cause  or guide physicians in decision-making for treatment. Therefore, there is an  urgent need to develop a more accurate and robust tool for effective clinical  management and drug development in lupus patients. It is fortunate that the  emerging Omics have empowered scientists in the discovery and identification of  potential novel biomarkers of SLE, especially the markers from blood, urine,  cerebrospinal fluids (CSF), and other bodily fluids. However, many of these  markers have not been carefully validated for clinical use. In addition, it is  apparent that individual biomarkers lack sensitivity or specificity. This review  summarizes the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic value of emerging  biomarkers from recent studies, and discusses the potential of these markers in  the development of biomarker panel based diagnostics or disease monitoring system  in SLE.

T1  - Diagnostic, predictive and prognostic biomarkers in systemic lupus erythematosus: 
SP  - 139-149
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Biomarkers for diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis still  constitute an unmet need for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Focusing on  recent findings, this review summarises the current landscape of biomarkers in  lupus. RECENT FINDINGS: Urine activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM)  exhibited good diagnostic ability in SLE and lupus nephritis (LN) whereas  cerebrospinal fluid neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) showed  promise in neuropsychiatric SLE. Urine ALCAM, CD163 and vascular cell adhesion  molecule 1 (VCAM-1) may be useful in surveillance of LN. Urine monocyte  chemoattractant protein 1 was found to predict treatment response in SLE, and  urine CD163 and NGAL treatment response in LN. Serum complement component 3 (C3)  and urinary VCAM-1 have been reported to portend long-term renal prognosis in LN.  SUMMARY: NGAL holds promise as a versatile biomarker in SLE whereas urine ALCAM,  CD163 and VCAM-1 displayed good performance as biomarkers in LN. The overall lack  of concerted corroboration of leading candidates across multiple cohorts and  diverse populations leaves the current biomarker landscape in SLE in an urgent  need for further survey and systematic validation.

T1  - What can we learn from DNA methylation studies in lupus?
SP  - 108920
AB  - During the past twenty years, a wide range of studies have established the  existence of epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation changes, in  lupus. Epigenetic changes might have different contributions in children-onset  versus adult-onset lupus. DNA methylation alterations have been identified and  characterized in relation to disease activity and damage, different lupus  subtypes and responses to drugs. However, to date there has been no practical  application of these findings in the clinical milieu. In this article, we provide  a review of key studies showing the relationship between DNA methylation and the  many clinical aspects related to lupus. We also propose several options, in  relation to the range of methodological developments and experimental design,  that could optimize these findings and make them amenable for use in clinical  practice.

SP  - 936-943
AB  - There have been important developments in defining cutaneous lupus erythematosus  and dermatomyositis. The skin manifestations of these two diseases have a  profound impact on QOL, with both emotional and symptomatic impacts that are  important to address. The proliferation of potential therapeutic targets has made  it important to make sure that these diseases are defined in a way that they can  be included in translational and clinical studies of both localized and systemic  forms of the diseases. There are now validated disease tools and QOL studies that  are facilitating current and future scientific and therapeutic developments.

T1  - Something new about prognostic factors for lupus nephritis? A systematic review.
SP  - 2256-2267
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) affects 30-45% of patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and causes great morbidity and mortality. About 10-25% of  patients will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it has been described a  mortality of 10-20% at 10 years. The contribution of clinical and biological  markers to the prediction of outcome is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe the  factors, with measures of association, that predict the main outcomes of LN.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have conducted a systematic review. Medline, Embase, and  Cochrane Library were systematic searched from inception up to Oct 2019, with a  strategy that included synonyms of all targeted outcomes of LN: (kidney failure,  response to treatment, cardiovascular events, and mortality). Only studies with  longitudinal prospective design or with warranties of unbiased recollection of  the prognostic factors, where LN was confirmed by biopsy were included. Risk of  bias was assessed with the New Castle Ottawa scale. Predictive factors and their  effect measures were collected from each study. RESULTS: From 1221 studies  identified, 25 studies were included, of which 15 were retrospective, nine  prospective, and one was a trial extension study (range from 3 months to 11  years). The main predictive factors of renal response were serum creatinine (SCr)  and glomerular filtration rate C3 levels, titer of anti-C1q, and anti-dsDNA  antibodies. Renal histological findings such as class type (IV or V),  tubulointerstitial or vascular lesions and chronicity index were risk factors for  development of chronic kidney disease. The factors associated with persistence of  activity were proteinuria, anti-dsDNA, anticardiolipin, anti C1q antibodies, and  complement values. The factors associated to cardiovascular events and mortality  were age, smoking, amount of proteinuria, and histological findings, such as  vascular lesions. Meta-analysis was precluded given the heterogeneity of designs  definitions and effect measures. CONCLUSIONS: Nowadays, we do not have new  biomarkers that establish the renal prognosis of patients with LN. Classical  clinical, renal, and histological markers are used in most studies. It is worth  noting the heterogeneity of studies in the definition of renal outcomes, which  complicates risk stratification in these patients.

T1  - Pregnancy and Autoimmune Disease.
SP  - 145-156
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancies in women with chronic disease are on the rise. This  pertains to autoimmune diseases in particular since these tend to affect women of  childbearing age. The interaction between pregnancy and autoimmune disease may  increase the risk of maternal, fetal, and obstetric complications; additional  care may be required. METHODS: This review is based on a selective literature  search in PubMed (2015-2020). RESULTS: In women with autoimmune diseases, the  course of pregnancy is highly variable. Some autoimmune diseases tend to improve  during pregnancy and do not to result in any serious obstetric complications.  Others may worsen during pregnancy, with deterioration of the maternal condition  as well as obstetric and perinatal complications. In systemic lupus erythematosus  and myasthenia gravis, placental transfer of specific autoantibodies may cause  fetal or neonatal disease. CONCLUSION: The care of pregnant women with chronic  diseases requires collaboration between specialists of the pertinent levels of  care. A stable course of disease before conception, close interdisciplinary care,  and pregnancy-compatible medication contribute to a reduction in maternal and  perinatal complications.

T1  - Rituximab in glomerular diseases: a case series and narrative review.
SP  - 187-195
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The use of Rituximab (RTX) in glomerular diseases (GD) has  increased in the past years, although it is still only used in a small fraction  of patients. METHODS: A single center retrospective study of adult patients with  membranous nephropathy (MN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), lupus  nephritis (LN), and vasculitis treated with RTX as first or second-line therapy  was conducted at our center from 2010 to 2020. RESULTS: We identified 19  patients; 36.8% had MN and 25.0% each had FSGS, LN, and vasculitis. RTX was  first-line therapy in 26.3% of patients and in 73.7% it was second-line therapy.  Mean follow-up time was 7.7 +/- 7.2 years. In MN, 2 patients (28.6%) had complete  remission (CR), 2 patients (28.6%) had partial remission (PR), and 3 patients  (42.9%) had no response (NR). In FSGS, 2 patients (50.0%) presented CR, 1 patient  (25.0%) had no response, and 1 patient had renal deterioration. Two patients  (50.0%) had a LN class IV with a CR after RTX, 1 patient with LN class IIIC/V had  no response, and 1 patient with LN class II had renal deterioration. In  vasculitis, 3 patients (75.0%) presented CR and 1 patient had PR. Infusion  reactions were present in 2 patients (10.5%) and one patient had multiple  infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of RTX in treating different  types of immune-mediated GD has been demonstrated with different response rates,  but an overall safe profile. In our case series, the results are also  encouraging. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the effect of  RTX in GD.

T1  - Comparing pregnancy outcomes in patients with criteria and non-criteria 
SP  - 5-18
AB  - BACKGROUND: Not all patients fulfil criteria for specific autoimmune rheumatic  diseases (ARDs) and are then defined as having non-criteria (nc)ARD. It is  uncertain whether well-recognised associations with adverse pregnancy outcomes in  patients with criteria ARD also exist in patients with ncARD or undifferentiated  connective tissue disease (UCTD). Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of  the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in various ncARD and UCTD compared  with criteria ARD to identify whether there are increased risks and to examine  for any benefits of treatment. METHODS: This study was conducted in accordance  with the guidance of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standard. A systematic literature review was performed  using online databases including Medline and PubMed from inception to the  beginning of April 2021 using appropriate keywords for various ARD and pregnancy  outcomes. RESULTS: After screening 665 articles, 36 articles were chosen for full  text review and 15 selected for final analysis. There were eight studies of nc  antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) of more than 7000 pregnancies and seven studies  of UCTD of more than 1000 pregnancies. No studies of any other ncARD in pregnancy  were identified. We found that patients with either ncAPS or UCTD seem to have an  increased burden of poor pregnancy outcomes compared with the general population.  Despite the heterogeneity and poor quality of the studies, we also noted that  ncAPS and criteria APS patients may have similar rates of obstetric complications  with standard and/or non-standard APS treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: Our  findings of increased risks of poor pregnancy outcomes in patients with ncAPS or  UCTD will be helpful for pre-pregnancy counselling and management of these  patients in pregnancy and support their referral to specialist  obstetric-rheumatology and obstetric-haematology clinics.

T1  - Differences in the Clinical Manifestations and Mortality of Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 116-126
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the differences between  childhood-onset and adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE and aSLE) for  clinical manifestations and mortality using a meta-analytic approach. METHODS:  The PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched for eligible studies  published between January 1982 and March 2021. The odds ratio (OR) with 95%  confidence interval was used to calculate the pooled effect estimates using the  random-effects model. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies involving 21,946 SLE patients  were included. cSLE was associated with an increased risk of malar rash (OR:  1.64; p < 0.001), ulcers/mucocutaneous involvement (OR: 1.22; p = 0.039), general  neurological involvement (OR: 1.52; p < 0.001), seizures (OR: 1.92; p < 0.001),  general renal involvement (OR: 2.08; p < 0.001), proteinuria (OR: 1.35; p =  0.015), urinary cellular casts (OR: 1.67; p = 0.047), fever (OR: 2.31; p <  0.001), anemia (OR: 1.91; p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (OR: 1.41; p < 0.001),  leucopenia (OR: 1.57; p = 0.017), lymphadenopathy (OR: 2.40; p < 0.001), and  cutaneous vasculitis (OR: 1.72; p = 0.001) as compared with aSLE. Moreover, cSLE  versus aSLE was associated with a reduced risk of articular manifestations (OR:  0.63; p = 0.001), pulmonary involvement (OR: 0.54; p = 0.001), and pleuritis (OR:  0.61; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between cSLE and aSLE for  mortality risk (OR: 1.20; p = 0.203). CONCLUSION: We found that certain clinical  manifestations of SLE are different in cSLE and aSLE. Moreover, the mortality  risk of cSLE and aSLE was not significantly different.

T1  - Relapse rates and risk factors for unfavorable neurological prognosis of 
SP  - 102996
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transverse myelitis (TM) is a rare but severe systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) manifestation. To date, the prognostic factors for  SLE-associated TM have been far less well-studied. There are also controversial  data on the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs), Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, longitudinal extensive  transverse myelitis (LETM), and decreased complement levels with the outcome of  TM. We aimed to review the potential prognostic factors and integrate relapse  rates of observational studies for SLE-associated TM. METHOD: To review the  prognosis for SLE-associated TM, relevant articles published up to July 30, 2021,  were comprehensively and systematically identified from PubMed, EMBASE and Web of  Science databases. Five studies encompassing 283 patients with SLE-related TM  were included in this meta-analysis; raw data were obtained from three studies.  RESULTS: The risk factors for unfavorable neurological outcome included  demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory data, among which a  grade of A, B or C on the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale  (AIS) at the onset of TM was associated with poor prognosis (OR: 56.05, 95% CI:  6.29-499.25, P < 0.001). The presence of hypoglycorrhachia was also correlated  with a worse prognosis (OR: 10.78, 95% CI: 3.74-31.07, P < 0.001). No noticeable  correlation was revealed between a poor outcome and positive aPLs and different  aPLs profiles (anticardiolipin antibody [aCL], anti-beta2-glycoprotein I  (anti-beta2GPI], lupus anticoagulant [LA]). The pooled 1-, 3- and 5-year relapse  rates were 22% (95% CI: 0.13-0.31), 34% (95% CI: 0.22-0.47) and 36% (95% CI:  0.14-0.58), respectively. No significant publication bias was found. CONCLUSION:  A grade of A, B, or C on the AIS at initial TM and the presence of  hypoglycorrhachia were found to be related to a worse prognosis in patients with  SLE-associated TM. Notably, aPLs and different aPLs profiles may not suggest poor  neurological outcome. The long-term relapse rate of patients with SLE-associated  TM was relatively high. We recommend that treatment be stratified based on the  initial severity of myelitis. For patients with severe myelitis, early intensive  therapy may be initiated as soon as possible.

SP  - 66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet plays a critical role in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  patients, impacting on the microbiota composition and, consequently, on the  immune response. The objective was to analyze and verify the diet effect on SLE  patients. METHODS: This is a systematic review performed at the Evidences-based  Health Lab, Escola Superior em Ciencias da Saude, Brasilia (DF), Brazil. In  March, 2021, five databases, and grey literature, through JSTOR, Open Grey, and  Google Scholar were searched. Randomized Clinical Trials in which SLE patients  with calorie restricted, low glycemic index or other diet involving the joint  adequacy of these aspects, compared with placebo or different types of diet, were  included. RESULTS: It was identified in the databases 758 articles; 132 were  duplicated; 616 references were screened, and 604 were excluded. After reading  the title and abstract, 12 articles were included for full-text reading. After  the full-text reading, three studies were included for quantitative analysis. The  diet improved the quality of life at 6 (MD 16.30; 5.91;26.69) and 12 weeks (MD  14.60; 0.88;28.32). The GRADE was used to evaluate the quality of evidence.  CONCLUSION: There is low evidence that the diet has a positive impact on the  quality of life of SLE patients. Trial registration PROSPERO-CRD4202012208.

SP  - 1069-1074
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease involving multiple  organs, and lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common renal complication of SLE.  Belimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that can reduce the number of  B cells, thereby reducing the formation of autoantibodies. Belimumab can improve  SLE response index and SLE disease activity score and delay the progression of LN  in both adults and children and thus plays an important role in the treatment of  SLE and LN. This article reviews related research reports of belimumab used in  the treatment of children and adults with SLE in China and overseas and analyzes  the efficacy and safety of belimumab in pediatric patients, in order to provide a  reference for the clinical application of belimumab in children with SLE.

T1  - Measurement of specific organ domains in lupus randomized controlled trials: a 
SP  - 1341-1353
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in SLE (lupus) typically adopt  composite responder definitions as primary efficacy endpoints; however, outcomes  within individual organ domains are also important to understand. The aim of this  scoping review was to evaluate how organ-specific disease activity and  therapeutic responses have been measured and reported in lupus RCTs. METHODS: We  searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane registry and clinicaltrials.gov. Eligible  studies were RCTs investigating efficacy of an immune-directed drug therapy in  active SLE, published January 2000-March 2021, excluding studies limited to lupus  nephritis. Data were extracted independently in duplicate into a template and  summarized descriptively. RESULTS: Thirty-four RCTs were included, of which 32  (94%) reported activity and/or responses in at least one organ domain. Study  populations had a high, although variable, frequency of baseline musculoskeletal  and mucocutaneous activity and low, but also variable, representation of other  domains. Definitions of organ-specific responses were inconsistent, even within  individual instruments. Response in most organ domains were evaluated using BILAG  and SLEDAI components but meaningful comparison between treatment arms was  limited by small subgroups analysed in a post hoc fashion. Specific mucocutaneous  and arthritis instruments were also used, including within pre-specified  organ-specific endpoints, which discriminated between treatment arms in some  studies. CONCLUSION: Mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations predominate  in SLE RCTs. Organ-specific outcome measures are commonly reported, but  definitions of involvement and response are inconsistent. Research into the  development of new outcome measures for key organ domains, and validation and  comparison of response definitions using existing instruments, is needed.

T1  - Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy: Hope for Patients With Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 728190
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease. Although  previous studies have demonstrated that SLE is related to the imbalance of cells  in the immune system, including B cells, T cells, and dendritic cells, etc., the  mechanisms underlying SLE pathogenesis remain unclear. Therefore, effective and  low side-effect therapies for SLE are lacking. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell  (MSC) therapy for autoimmune diseases, particularly SLE, has gained increasing  attention. This therapy can improve the signs and symptoms of refractory SLE by  promoting the proliferation of Th2 and Treg cells and inhibiting the activity of  Th1, Th17, and B cells, etc. However, MSC therapy is also reported ineffective in  some patients with SLE, which may be related to MSC- or patient-derived factors.  Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs should be further confirmed. This  review summarizes the status of MSC therapy in refractory SLE treatment and  potential reasons for the ineffectiveness of MSC therapy from three perspectives.  We propose various MSC modification methods that may be beneficial in enhancing  the immunosuppression of MSCs in SLE. However, their safety and protective  effects in patients with SLE still need to be confirmed by further experimental  and clinical evidence.

T1  - Vitamin D and Rheumatic Diseases: A Review of Clinical Evidence.
AB  - Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining a healthy mineralized skeleton.  It is also considered an immunomodulatory agent that regulates innate and  adaptive immune systems. The aim of this narrative review is to provide general  concepts of vitamin D for the skeletal and immune health, and to summarize the  mechanistic, epidemiological, and clinical evidence on the relationship between  vitamin D and rheumatic diseases. Multiple observational studies have  demonstrated the association between a low level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D  [25(OH)D] and the presence and severity of several rheumatic diseases, such as  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  spondyloarthropathies, and osteoarthritis (OA). Nevertheless, the specific  benefits of vitamin D supplements for the treatment and prevention of rheumatic  diseases are less accepted as the results from randomized clinical trials are  inconsistent, although some conceivable benefits of vitamin D for the improvement  of disease activity of RA, SLE, and OA have been demonstrated in meta-analyses.  It is also possible that some individuals might benefit from vitamin D  differently than others, as inter-individual difference in responsiveness to  vitamin D supplementation has been observed in genomic studies. Although the  optimal level of serum 25(OH)D is still debatable, it is advisable it is  advisable that patients with rheumatic diseases should maintain a serum 25(OH)D  level of at least 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) to prevent osteomalacia, secondary  osteoporosis, and fracture, and possibly 40-60 ng/mL (100-150 nmol/L) to achieve  maximal benefit from vitamin D for immune health and overall health.

T1  - Multiple brain abscesses due to Listeria monocytogenes infection in a patient 
SP  - 1427-1439
AB  - AIM: To review the clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  complicated by central nervous system (CNS) infection due to Listeria  monocytogenes. METHOD: A patient with SLE receiving high-dose glucocorticoids  combined with cyclophosphamide who developed multiple brain abscesses due to  Listeria infection is described. The case is compared with known cases in a  literature review. RESULTS: A review of the literature showed that CNS infections  are rare bacterial complications of SLE, but they can be a significant cause of  mortality, especially those due to L. monocytogenes. The most significant risk  factor for listerial meningitis is a prior history of receiving immunosuppressive  therapy. At-risk patients should avoid unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses along  with deli-style, ready-to-eat prepared meats, particularly poultry products. The  case we report is the fifth SLE patient with multiple brain abscesses due to  L. monocytogenes, and the first to be discharged with no sequelae. Timely and  accurate identification and treatment of CNS infections and neuropsychiatric  lupus are very important for favorable disease prognosis. CONCLUSION: Repeated  blood culture is helpful for early diagnosis, and empirical anti-infective  treatment that covers L. monocytogenes is recommended for SLE patients with risk  factors when CNS infection occurs. A comprehensive assessment might be helpful to  distinguish CNS infections from neuropsychiatric SLE. For severe infection, the  dosage of steroids does not need to be reduced immediately but can be gradually  adjusted based on the results of a comprehensive evaluation of the disease.

T1  - PD-1/PD-L1 blockade: Prospectives for immunotherapy in cancer and autoimmunity.
SP  - 1293-1306
AB  - Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) has become a successful cancer  treatment approach in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Blockade of programmed  death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with monoclonal antibodies  have been known as successful examples of cancer immunotherapy in recent years.  Although ICBT has been shown to be beneficial in cancers, such benefits have only  been seen in a portion of cancer patients. In this regard, enhancing the  therapeutic effects of inhibiting PD-1 and PD-L1 and reducing the side effects of  this approach can be considered as a potential approach in a successful ICBT. In  this review, we have highlighted new viewpoints regarding improving the  therapeutic effect of PD-1 and PD-L1 blockades in cancer therapy. Besides, their  expression levels as a biomarker with prognostic value, their role in intestinal  microbiota modulation, combination therapy, and immune-related side effects  (irAEs) have been discussed.

SP  - 699-706
AB  - Inflammatory rheumatic diseases often affect women of childbearing age, for whom  pregnancy is still associated with increased risks. At the same time, we are  gaining more and more insights into risk factors and preventive strategies,  enabling almost all women to have successful pregnancies with few adverse  outcomes. The cornerstones are planning of the pregnancy under effective disease  control and the modification of individual risk factors. Hydroxychloroquine is  once again coming into focus as a compound with multiple positive effects.  Recommendations published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) provide  a practical overview of the evidence. Based on the current state of knowledge,  rheumatologists can make a lasting contribution to a positive pregnancy outcome  for mother and child.

T1  - Prognostic and Diagnostic Values of Novel Serum and Urine Biomarkers in Lupus 
SP  - 559-571
AB  - INTRODUCTION: While renal biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing lupus  nephritis (LN), the prognostic and diagnostic role of non-invasive biomarkers for  LN is currently debated. METHODS: Available studies published in last 5 years  (2015-2020) assessing the diagnostic and prognostic value of urinary and/or  serological biomarkers in subjects with LN were analyzed in this systematic  review. RESULTS: Eighty-five studies were included (comprehending 13,496 patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], 8,872 LN, 487 pediatric LN, 3,977 SLE  but no LN, 160 pediatric SLE but no LN and 7,679 controls). Most of the studies  were cross-sectional (62; 73%), while 14 (17%) were prospective. In sixty studies  (71%), the diagnosis of LN was biopsy-confirmed. Forty-four out of 85 (52%)  investigated only serological biomarkers, 29 studies (34%) tested their  population only with urinary biomarkers, and 12 (14%) investigated the presence  of both. Outcome measures to assess the clinical utility of the analyzed  biomarkers were heterogeneous, including up to 21 different activity scores, with  the SLEDAI (in 60%) being the most used. Despite some heterogeneity, promising  results have been shown for biomarkers such as urinary monocyte chemoattractant  protein, urinary adiponectin, and urinary vascular cell adhesion protein 1.  DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: While serum and urine biomarkers have the potential to  improve diagnostic and prognostic pathways in patients with LN, the vast  heterogeneity across studies severely limits their applicability in current  clinical practice. With the kidney biopsy still representing the gold standard,  future efforts should focus on harmonizing study inclusion criteria and outcomes,  particularly in clinical trials, in order to improve comparability and facilitate  the implementations of available biomarkers into the daily practice.

SP  - 7712587
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between the use of biological  disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and the risk of cardiovascular  events in patients with systemic inflammatory conditions. METHODS: Eligible  cohort studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception to January  2021 were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)  for cardiovascular outcomes were calculated in the fixed- and random-effects  model accordingly. Associated factors with risks of cardiovascular events were  also studied in sensitivity analyses and metaregression analyses. RESULTS:  Compared with non-bDMARD users, the risks of myocardial infarction (MI) (OR =  0.74, 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.87), heart failure (OR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.95),  cardiovascular (CV) death (OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.95), all-cause mortality  (OR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.70), and 3P-MACE (composite endpoint of MI, stroke,  and CV death) (OR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89) were significantly reduced in  bDMARD users, which were mainly driven by the risk reduction in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis (RA). TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibited consistent benefits in  reducing the risks of MI, heart failure, CV death, all-cause mortality, and  3P-MACE. Moreover, the risks of heart failure, CV death, all-cause mortality, and  3P-MACE were significantly reduced in bDMARD users with follow-up over one year.  CONCLUSIONS: The use of bDMARDs might be associated with the reduced risks of CV  events, especially in patients with RA. The CV events might be less frequent in  bDMARD users with TNF-alpha inhibitors or follow-up over one year. More  investigations are needed to validate conclusions.

T1  - [The treatment of lupus nephritis, between consolidated strategies and new 
AB  - Over a half of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus will develop lupus  nephritis (LN). The diagnosis of LN, suspected based on clinical data  (proteinuria, active urinary sediment, renal dysfunction), is confirmed with  renal biopsy. The immunosuppressive treatment of proliferative classes of LN is  based on an induction phase, where high-dose steroids are used in conjunction  with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or cyclophosphamide, and a subsequent  maintenance phase, that combines low-dose steroids with MMF or azathioprine.  Different classes of drugs (calcineurin inhibitors, anti-CD20) can be used as an  alternative, or in resistant forms of LN, although their role is less  well-established. Recently published (or nearing completion) studies have opened  up the possibility of using new drugs in LN. In particular, depletion  (Obinutuzumab, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) or neutralization (Belimumab,  anti-"B-cell activating factor" monoclonal antibody) of B lymphocytes, and the  use of a calcineurin inhibitor with a low profile of renal and systemic toxicity  (Voclosporin) demonstrated an improvement in renal response in addition to  standard therapy.

T1  - Biochemical and clinical predictors in pregnant women with antiphospholipid 
SP  - 1153-1160
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoimmune diseases as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) could cause many maternal complications. The most  common maternal complications of autoimmune diseases are lupus flare,  hypertension, nephritis, preeclampsia (PE), eclampsia, and poor pregnancy  outcomes which including preterm delivery and pregnancy loss. Only the lupus  anticoagulant in the greatest prospective multicenter study has been associated  with adverse pregnancy outcomes of the APS. PURPOSE: This review aims to provide  a comprehensive update for predictors in pregnant women with APS/SLE. METHODS:  These data have been collected from clinical and pathological studies, systematic  reviews, and meta-analysis. RESULTS: In recent years the SLE and APS demonstrated  to have different and valuable clinical and biomarker predictors for the  pregnancy outcome. Treatment of pregnant women with APS is low molecular weight  heparin (LMWH) and aspirin; however, around 75% of this management is considered  successful. CONCLUSION: This review summarizes recent research that focuses on  biochemical and clinical predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) of  pregnant women with SLE and APS. Furthermore, we have collected more evidence  that confirms the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) preventing  APOs.

T1  - Immune-Related Urine Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Lupus Nephritis.
AB  - The kidney is one of the main organs affected by the autoimmune disease systemic  lupus erythematosus. Lupus nephritis (LN) concerns 30-60% of adult SLE patients  and it is significantly associated with an increase in the morbidity and  mortality. The definitive diagnosis of LN can only be achieved by histological  analysis of renal biopsies, but the invasiveness of this technique is an obstacle  for early diagnosis of renal involvement and a proper follow-up of LN patients  under treatment. The use of urine for the discovery of non-invasive biomarkers  for renal disease in SLE patients is an attractive alternative to repeated renal  biopsies, as several studies have described surrogate urinary cells or analytes  reflecting the inflammatory state of the kidney, and/or the severity of the  disease. Herein, we review the main findings in the field of urine immune-related  biomarkers for LN patients, and discuss their prognostic and diagnostic value.  This manuscript is focused on the complement system, antibodies and  autoantibodies, chemokines, cytokines, and leukocytes, as they are the main  effectors of LN pathogenesis.

SP  - 102898
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether adding repeated 125 mg methyl-prednisolone pulses  (MP) to Eurolupus fortnightly intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) improves  remission of lupus nephritis (LN) compared with recommended schedules. METHODS:  Observational comparative study of patients with biopsy-confirmed class III, IV  or V LN: 30 in the mycophenolate (MMF) group, 25 in the CYC group and 38 in the  CYC-MP group. The main efficacy outcome was complete response at 12 months.  RESULTS: Patients in the CYC-MP group received lower doses of prednisone within  6 months (mean 8.5 mg/d, vs. 15 mg/d in the MMF group vs. 24 mg/d in the CYC  group, respectively). The complete response rates at 12 months were: CYC-MP 86%;  CYC 56%; MMF 47% (p = 0.002) at Pr/Cr <0.5; CYC-MP 86%; CYC 65%; MMF 63%  (p = 0.07) at Pr/Cr </=0.7. The cumulative 12-month response rates for the CYC-MP,  CYC and MMF groups were, respectively, 0.90, 0.58 and 0.63 (p = 0.004). In the  adjusted Cox model, patients receiving CYC-MP were more likely to achieve  complete response at Pr/Cr <0.5 than those in the MMF (HR vs. CYC-MP 0.33, 95%CI  0.16-0.65) and the CYC groups (HR vs. CYC-MP 0.47, 95%CI 0.21-1.04).  Glucocorticoid-related toxicity was seen in 2.6% of the CYC-MP group, 24% of the  CYC group and 20% of the MMF group (p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: The addition MP of  125 mg to each fortnightly dose of 500 mg of CYC improves response rates and  reduces the need for oral glucocorticoids in patients with class III, IV and V  LN.

T1  - Clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of valproate-induced pleural 
SP  - 869-876
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Valproic acid is a carboxylic acid derivative commonly prescribed  for several types of seizure disorders or for acute manic episodes in patients  with bipolar disorder. Several cases of valproate-induced pleural effusion have  been reported, although the precise pathophysiological mechanism remains unknown.  OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation of pleural effusion associated with  valproate use and to categorize published case reports according to clinical,  immunological, and pleural effusion cell type. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase  databases were systematically searched from January 1970 until November 2020  using the following search terms: "valproic acid" OR "valproate" OR "pleural  fluid" OR "exudative effusion" OR "transudative effusion" OR "valproic lung  adverse events". These searches yielded 171 references of which 135 articles were  considered irrelevant, leaving 36 potentially relevant references which were  carefully scrutinized. Twenty-eight cases of valproate-induced pleural effusion  were identified after excluding two articles reporting five patients with lung  parenchymal adverse reactions to treatment with valproic acid; two articles  reporting three patients in whom the pleural effusion could not be attributed to  valproic acid alone; one case discussing valproate therapy and fungal pleural  effusion; and one describing a patient who suffered from severe cardiac failure.  There were also two cases, in an abstract form, with pericardial and pleural  effusion, but without any further informative details, and, thus, they were also  excluded from this survey. EXUDATIVE EOSINOPHILIC PLEURAL EFFUSION: This was the  most common type of valproate-induced pleural effusion reported in 17 out of 28  cases (60.7%), with concurrent peripheral eosinophilia in ten. Acute  hypersensitivity reaction, inflammation of the pleural cavity induced by the  drug, drug toxicity, and damage to mesothelial cells due to oxidants, comprise  the possible pivotal mechanisms. EXUDATIVE LYMPHOCYTIC PLEURAL EFFUSION: This was  reported in two cases, with concurrent pericardial effusion in one.  Discontinuation of valproate led to resolution of the effusion, although the  underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain abstruse. Interestingly, a  patient presented with recurrent pleural effusion characterized by transition  from eosinophilic to lymphocytic predominance after readministration of  valproate. TRANSUDATIVE PLEURAL EFFUSION: Three out of 28 cases (10.7%) were  characterized by neutrophilic transudative pleural effusion after long-term  therapy with valproate, while concurrent pericardial effusion was also noted in  two. VALPROATE-INDUCED LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS WITH PLEURAL EFFUSION: Five patients  receiving valproate therapy (17.9% out of the 28 cases) developed drug-induced  lupus erythematosus with concurrent pleural effusion that was eosinophilic in  three. All patients had positive antinuclear antibodies; anti-histone antibodies  were positive in two. CONCLUSIONS: Valproate-induced pleural effusion is rare,  but patients receiving treatment with valproic acid who develop respiratory  symptoms should be examined for valproate-induced pleural effusion.

T1  - 10 Years of belimumab experience: What have we learnt?
SP  - 1705-1721
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease  affecting both adults and children. Belimumab is the only biologic approved for  SLE, and the first in a class of drugs known as B-lymphocyte stimulator-specific  inhibitors. The introduction of intravenous belimumab in 2011 was a major  advance, being the first new therapy approved for SLE in over 50 years. As of  April 2021, more than 7200 people with SLE have received belimumab in clinical  studies, and it is approved in over 75 countries for the treatment of adults with  SLE. A subcutaneous, self-injectable belimumab formulation was licensed in 2017  by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency  (EMA). Belimumab was then approved for use in children in Europe, the USA and  Japan in 2019, and China and Brazil in 2020. Recently, belimumab became the first  FDA-approved drug for the treatment of adults with active lupus nephritis (LN),  the most-common severe manifestation of SLE.Over the past 10 years, belimumab has  established its position as a disease modifier in the SLE treatment paradigms.  Robust evidence from randomised clinical studies and observational, real-world  studies has demonstrated the tolerability and efficacy of belimumab for reducing  disease activity and the risk of new, severe SLE flares. This enables patients to  taper their glucocorticoid use, which limits damage accumulation. Significantly  more patients with active LN met the criteria for renal responses and were at  less risk of a renal-related event or death after receiving belimumab plus  standard therapy, compared with standard therapy on top of mandatory steroid  reduction. Ongoing clinical studies are evaluating belimumab's effectiveness in  various indications beyond SLE. Post-marketing and registry studies are gathering  additional data on key areas such as pregnancy outcomes after belimumab exposure  and belimumab co-administration with other biologics.

SP  - 481-499
AB  - Despite progress in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  remission rates and health-related quality of life remain disappointingly low.  The paucity of successful SLE clinical trials reminds us that we still have a  long way to go. Nevertheless, there are clear signs of hope. We highlight results  from recent studies of novel therapeutic strategies based on emerging insights  into our understanding of SLE disease mechanisms. We also highlight several  studies that inform optimal use of existing treatments to improve efficacy and/or  limit toxicity. These developments suggest we may yet unlock the key toward more  satisfactory treatment outcomes in SLE.

SP  - 441-455
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that primarily  affects women of childbearing age. Pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality are  well described in SLE; however, better management of disease activity throughout  the disease course have minimized periods of disease activity and damage accrual,  making pregnancy more feasible and desirable. A growing body of literature has  defined risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with SLE, and  coordinated medical and obstetric management has allowed most patients with SLE  to safely achieve full-term pregnancies by timing pregnancy to maximal disease  quiescence and use of pregnancy-compatible medications from preconception through  lactation.

AB  - The assessment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity in clinical  trials has been challenging. This is related to the wide spectrum of SLE  manifestations and the heterogeneity of the disease trajectory. Currently,  composite outcome measures are most commonly used as a primary endpoint while  organ-specific measures are often used as secondary outcomes. In this article, we  review the outcome measures and endpoints used in most recent clinical trials and  explore potential avenues for further development of new measures and the  refinement of existing tools.

T1  - Strategies to Use Nanoparticles to Generate CD4 and CD8 Regulatory T Cells for 
SP  - 681062
AB  - Autoimmune diseases are disorders of immune regulation where the mechanisms  responsible for self-tolerance break down and pathologic T cells overcome the  protective effects of T regulatory cells (Tregs) that normally control them. The  result can be the initiation of chronic inflammatory diseases. Systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases are generally treated with  pharmacologic or biological agents that have broad suppressive effects. These  agents can halt disease progression, yet rarely cure while carrying serious  adverse side effects. Recently, nanoparticles have been engineered to correct  homeostatic regulatory defects and regenerate therapeutic antigen-specific Tregs.  Some approaches have used nanoparticles targeted to antigen presenting cells to  switch their support from pathogenic T cells to protective Tregs. Others have  used nanoparticles targeted directly to T cells for the induction and expansion  of CD4+ and CD8+ Tregs. Some of these T cell targeted nanoparticles have been  formulated to act as tolerogenic artificial antigen presenting cells. This  article discusses the properties of these various nanoparticle formulations and  the strategies to use them in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The  restoration and maintenance of Treg predominance over effector cells should  promote long-term autoimmune disease remission and ultimately prevent them in  susceptible individuals.

T1  - Osteopontin: another piece in the systemic lupus erythematosus immunopathology 
SP  - 173-182
AB  - Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphoglycoprotein involved in bone remodelling, wound  healing, cell adhesion, tissue remodelling, and immune response that is  distributed widely in normal adult tissues. OPN biological activity is regulated  by thrombin and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) cleavage, where the full-length  (OPN-FL) protein and the cleaved OPN-N are associated with autoimmune diseases  such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). OPN overexpression has been  associated with a predisposition to SLE and bad prognosis since OPN could mediate  a sustained polyclonal B cell activation that besides to intracellular OPN (iOPN)  form, promote the T follicular helper (TFH) cells and enhance anti-nuclear  antibody production. Currently, the role of OPN in lupus nephritis (LN) has been  reported and extensively studied; however, no data are available about the  potential mechanism of OPN in neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). In this review, we  highlighted the contribution of OPN and iOPN in LN and NPSLE immunopathology.

T1  - Acute acalculous cholecystitis as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus 
SP  - e26238
AB  - RATIONALE: Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is an extremely rare  manifestation of systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). In previous reports, most of  the patients were already diagnosed cases of SLE upon confirmation of AAC.  PATIENT CONCERNS: A 24-year-old female who initially presented with fever and  acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had no medical history. DIAGNOSES:  Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) showed gallbladder  thickening with pericholecystic edema without gallstones or sludge, demonstrating  acalculous cholecystitis. She revealed discoid rash on the both shin. Laboratory  tests revealed pancytopenia. The titer of antinuclear antibody (ANA) was 1:1280.  Anti-dsDNA antibody, anti-phospholipid antibody, anti-Sm antibody test, and  proteinuria in 24 hours were positive. Both C3 and C4 were low. Echocardiography  and chest CT showed pericardial effusion and pleural effusion. Using the 2019  European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR)  classification criteria, the score was 31. We thought AAC of this case that was  one of the initial manifestations of SLE. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated  with high-dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg) and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg. OUTCOMES:  After 4 days of administration of high-dose corticosteroid therapy, symptoms  rapidly improved. After 35 days of the treatment, her symptoms and disease  activity of SLE were markedly improved. LESSONS: Although AAC being the initial  manifestation of SLE is very rare, prompt diagnosis and management with  corticosteroids precluded surgical intervention. Physicians need to be cognizant  of AAC as a disease flare and as a rare initial manifestation of SLE.

T1  - Immune thrombocytopenia and COVID-19: Case report and review of literature.
SP  - 1515-1521
AB  - Immune thrombocytopenia, also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), has  been reported as an important complication related to COVID-19.We present a  49-year-old male patient with systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus nephritis,  antiphospholipid syndrome and history of ITP who developed an ITP flare in the  context of COVID-19. He had no bleeding manifestations and had a good response to  prednisone treatment.We review the characteristics of the cases reported to date  in the literature, with an analysis of 57 patients. Mean age was 56 years (+/-19.6  SD), and 50.9% were male. This was the first episode of ITP in most of the  patients (86.05%), with SARS-CoV-2 acting as the initial trigger. We found that  ITP flares may appear in both mild and severe COVID-19 cases. They also appeared  at any time during the course of the disease, 48.2% of patients developed it  during hospitalization, while it was diagnosed at admission in the rest of the  cases. Platelet counts were significantly lower than other ITP series, with a  median nadir platelet count of 8 x 10(9)/L (IQR 2-17.75 x 10(9)/L). These  patients show a higher bleeding rate (61.4%) compared with other ITP series. They  also show a better response to treatment, with good response to the first line  therapies in 76.9% of them. The most common first-line treatment was intravenous  immunoglobulin (IVIG), used alone or combined with corticosteroids in 40.4% and  32.7% of cases respectively, while 25% of patients received only  corticosteroids.Our review suggests that COVID-19-related ITP can be seen even in  previously healthy patients. Clinicians must be aware that ITP may appear both in  mild and severe COVID-19, at any time during its course. Given that this kind of  ITP seems to be associated with a higher bleeding risk, its diagnosis in a  clinical scenario such as COVID-19, where anticoagulant therapy is frequently  used, may be critical. Treatment with IVIG and/or corticoids is often effective.

T1  - Prevention of infective complications in systemic lupus erythematosus: A 
SP  - 880-895
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a more common autoimmune rheumatic disease  in the Asia-Pacific region. The prognosis of SLE remains unsatisfactory in some  Asian countries because of delayed diagnosis, limited access to medications,  increased complications and issues of tolerability and adherence to treatment.  The Asia-Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology SLE special interest  group has recently published a set of consensus recommendations on the management  of SLE for specialists, family physicians, specialty nurses, and other healthcare  professionals in the Asia-Pacific region. This article reports a systematic  literature review of the infective complications of SLE in Asia and evidence for  prevention of these infections by pre-emptive antimicrobial therapy and  vaccination.

T1  - Lupus acute cardiomyopathy is highly responsive to intravenous immunoglobulin 
SP  - e25591
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is currently used with  considerable success for the treatment of many autoimmune diseases, including  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Among its various indications, IVIg has also  been found to be beneficial in myocarditis, whether or not it is associated with  an autoimmune disease. Nevertheless, data regarding IVIg treatment for  myocarditis/cardiomyopathy in patients with SLE are sparse. The objective of this  case series was to describe our experience with IVIg as a treatment for lupus  myocarditis and to review the literature for IVIg for this indication. PATIENT  CONCERNS: We report 5 female patients with SLE, who presented with signs of acute  heart failure including pulmonary congestion and arrhythmias. DIAGNOSIS:  Echocardiography demonstrated new reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of  20% to 30%. Two patients underwent coronary artery angiography, which  demonstrated normal coronary arteries, supporting the diagnosis of myocarditis or  nonischemic cardiomyopathy. INTERVENTIONS: High-dose IVIg treatment was initiated  in all 5 patients. OUTCOMES: Following the treatment, clinical and  echocardiographic improvement in cardiac function occurred within a few days to  1 month. This dramatic improvement persisted for several years. CONCLUSION: Based  on our case series, we believe that IVIg has an important role in the management  of lupus acute cardiomyopathy. This safe, well-tolerated optional treatment  should be considered, especially in severe cases.

T1  - Systemic toxicity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: prevalence, mechanisms, 
SP  - 1189-1202
AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxylated analog, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are  4-aminoquinoline initially used as an antimalarial treatment. CQ and HCQ  (4-aminoquinoline, 4-AQ) are today used in rheumatology, especially to treat  rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Their mechanism of action  revolves around a singular triptych: 4-AQ acts as alkalizing agents, ionized  amphiphilic molecules, and by binding to numerous targets. 4-AQ have so  pleiotropic and original mechanisms of action, providing them an effect at the  heart of the regulation of several physiological functions. However, this broad  spectrum of action is also at the origin of various and original side effects,  notably a remarkable chronic systemic toxicity. We describe here the 4-AQ-induced  lesions on the eye, the heart, muscle, the nerves, the inner ear, and the kidney.  We also describe their prevalence, their pathophysiological mechanisms, their  risk factors, their potential severity, and the means to detect them early. Most  of these side effects are reversible if treatment is stopped promptly. This  4-AQ-induced toxicity must be known to prescribing physicians, to closely monitor  its appearance and stop treatment in time if necessary.

T1  - Hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis for preeclampsia, hypertension and prematurity in 
SP  - 1163-1174
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of HCQ in  improving the maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies with SLE. METHODS: A  literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane  database for relevant English language articles, and Wanfang, CNKI and VIP for  Chinese articles, from the databases' inception to April 30, 2020. These studies  compared the maternal and/or fetal outcomes between pregnant patients with SLE  who were administered HCQ during pregnancy (HCQ+ group) and those who were not  administered HCQ (HCQ- group). Two investigators extracted the data and assessed  the quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and GRADE criteria  independently. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were  calculated. All statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata 12.0  software. RESULTS: Nine studies involving 1132 pregnancies were included in the  study (3 case controls, 2 prospective cohorts, 4 retrospective cohorts).  Preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and prematurity were significantly lower  in the HCQ+ group than in the HCQ- group (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.59), (OR 0.41,  95% CI 0.19-0.89) and (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.86), respectively. There were no  significant differences in the rates of HELLP Syndrome (OR 0.88, 95% CI  0.19-3.96), gestational diabetes (OR 2.3, 95% CI 0.44-12.12), thrombotic events  (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.05-1.51), spontaneous abortion (OR 1.77, 95% CI 0.96-3.26),  premature rupture of membranes (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.24-1.39), oligohydramnios (OR  0.90, 95% CI 0.38-2.14), live birth (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.60-2.47), stillbirth (OR  1.00, 95% CI 0.50-2.00), congenital malformation (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.14-2.04), low  birth weight (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43-1.39), intrauterine distress (OR 1.07, 95% CI  0.41-2.76,), intrauterine growth restriction (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.06-5.43), or  five-minute APGAR score <7 (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.20-2.58) between the two groups.  CONCLUSIONS: HCQ treatment during pregnancy could reduce the risk of  preeclampsia, pregnancy hypertension and prematurity in SLE patients. The  certainty of evidence is high but majority of the studies included are  retrospective studies and not randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the  multidisciplinary management of pregnant patients with SLE should promote HCQ  use, irrespective of disease activity or severity.

T1  - Systematic review of digital and non-digital non-pharmacological interventions 
SP  - 1058-1077
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) experience  psychological comorbidities and impaired quality of life (QOL). We conducted a  systematic review to examine the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions  for improving psychological outcomes and/or QOL in patients with SLE. To expand  on a previous systematic review in this area and enhance our understanding of  efficacious interventions for this population, our search included  quasi-experimental and experimental studies of interventions delivered or  supported by remote methods (including digitally) or in person. METHODS: A  comprehensive literature search was conducted with a research librarian using the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  guidelines and was registered before data extraction on the international  prospective register of systematic reviews PROSPERO Web site (CRD42020154962).  The search included controlled-vocabulary and title/abstract terms related to  non-pharmacological interventions for SLE published through October 2019 in  MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library databases (Wiley), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL  (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), Web of Science (Clarivate), ACM Digital (Association  of Computer Machinery), and IEEE Xplore. Studies were synthesized using a  systematic narrative synthesis framework. Risk of bias was assessed. RESULTS:  Twenty-three studies were included: 21 randomized controlled trials and two  quasi-experimental studies. Non-pharmacological diet, physical activity,  psychological, and course-based interventions improved QOL and psychological  outcomes, and were delivered in traditional settings (e.g., hospital) or  remotely. No studies assessing digital non-pharmacological interventions were  identified in our search. Quality assessments showed serious risk of bias for the  two quasi-experimental studies, and high risk of bias in a subset of experimental  studies. CONCLUSIONS: Non-pharmacological interventions benefit patients with  SLE. Future research should include more representative samples in rigorous  evaluations and consider ways to incorporate digital technologies to increase  accessibility.

T1  - [Deescalation and glucocorticoid-free treatment in SLE].
SP  - 332-338
AB  - Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) without permanent glucocorticoid  therapy is inconceivable for most patients and their physicians. Although we have  significantly improved the prognosis of SLE, management remains constrained by  a lack of effective, targeted therapies and the lack of evidence-based approaches  to the use of existing compounds. For example, for glucocorticoids (GC), which  are used continuously in a majority of patients, there are no evidence-based  recommendations for initiation, tapering, and cessation in the treatment of SLE.  Even today, GC are without alternatives in acute situations, especially organ- or  life-threatening ones. However, due to the known long-term adverse effects, the  role of GC is viewed increasingly critically. Long-term data from cohorts show  that the use of GC actually contributes to morbidity and mortality in SLE.  Strategies to reduce the use of GC in SLE are therefore urgently needed and are  proposed in this paper.

T1  - Functional Characteristics and Application of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Systemic 
SP  - 7
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare, heterogeneous autoimmune and  autoinflammatory disease that affects both sexes and all races, although this  disease exhibits its highest incidence/prevalence among the black population and  shows a predilection for women of reproductive age. Although SLE has no cure,  treatment can help decrease its signs and symptoms. Thus, we should focus  primarily on personalized treatment. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), which  are multipotent cells capable of differentiating into osteoblasts, chondrocytes,  adipocytes, and myoblasts, among other cell types, are potential candidates for  use in a promising strategy to treat severe and refractory SLE. MSCs have an  immunomodulatory function that can suppress the proliferation and activities of  many immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural killer cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells. Substantial progress has recently been made in  MSC therapy, and experimental and clinical data suggest that such a therapy is a  promising strategy for the treatment of severe and refractory SLE. In this  review, we highlight the effects of MSCs on different immune cell types, describe  the mechanisms underlying MSC-mediated immunoregulation, and discuss the  treatment of SLE with MSCs from different sources in various animal models and  clinical applications.

T1  - Belimumab for systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - CD010668
AB  - BACKGROUND: Belimumab, the first biologic approved for the treatment of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), has been shown to reduce autoantibody levels in people  with SLE and help control disease activity. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits  and harms of belimumab (alone or in combination) in systematic lupus  erythematosus. SEARCH METHODS: An Information Specialist carried out the searches  of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the World Health  Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and  clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 25 September 2019. There were no language or  date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials  (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of belimumab (alone or in  combination) compared to placebo/control treatment (immunosuppressive drugs, such  as azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil or another biologic), in  adults with SLE. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodologic  procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: Six RCTs (2917 participants)  qualified for quantitative analyses. All included studies were multicenter,  international or US-based. The age range of the included participants was 22 to  80 years; most were women; and study duration ranged from 84 days to 76 weeks.  The risk of bias was generally low except for attrition bias, which was high in  67% of studies. Compared to placebo, more participants on belimumab 10 mg/kg  (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dose) showed at least a 4-point  improvement (reduction) in Safety of Estrogen in Lupus National Assessment  (SELENA) - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, a  validated SLE disease activity index: (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence  interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.45; 829/1589 in belimumab group and 424/1077 in placebo;  I(2)= 0%; 4 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). Change in health-related quality of  life (HRQOL), assessed by Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score  improvement (range 0 to 100), showed there was probably little or no difference  between groups (mean difference 1.6 points, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.90; 401 in belimumab  group and 400 in placebo; I(2)= 0%; 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). The  belimumab 10 mg/kg group showed greater improvement in glucocorticoid dose, with  a higher proportion of participants reducing their dose by at least 50% compared  to placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.15; 81/269 in belimumab group and 52/268 in  placebo; I(2)= 0%; 2 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). The proportion of  participants experiencing harm may not differ meaningfully between the belimumab  10 mg/kg and placebo groups: one or more serious adverse event (RR 0.87, 95% CI:  0.68 to 1.11; 238/1700 in belimumab group and 199/1190 in placebo; I(2)= 48%; 5  RCTs; low-certainty evidence; ); one or more serious infection (RR 1.01, 95% CI:  0.66 to 1.54; 44/1230 in belimumab group and 40/955 in placebo; I(2)= 0%; 4 RCTs;  moderate-certainty evidence); and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.82, 95%  CI: 0.63 to 1.07; 113/1700 in belimumab group and 94/1190 in placebo; I(2)= 0%; 5  RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). Mortality was rare, and may not differ  between belimumab 10 mg/kg and placebo (Peto odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to  3.25; 9/1714 in belimumab group and 6/1203 in placebo; I(2)= 4%; 6 RCTs;  low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The six studies that provided  evidence for benefits and harms of belimumab were well-designed, high-quality  RCTs. At the FDA-approved dose of 10 mg/kg, based on moderate to high-certainty  data, belimumab was probably associated with a clinically meaningful efficacy  benefit compared to placebo in participants with SLE at 52 weeks. Evidence  related to harms is inconclusive and mostly of moderate to low-certainty  evidence. More data are needed for the longer-term efficacy of belimumab.

T1  - Clinical disease activity and flare in SLE: Current concepts and novel 
SP  - 102615
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex and heterogeneous systemic  autoimmune disease associated with innate and adaptive immune dysregulation. SLE  occurs primarily in females of childbearing age, with increased prevalence and  severity in minority populations. Despite improvements in treatment modalities,  SLE patients frequently experience periods of heightened disease activity and  flare that can lead to permanent organ damage, increased morbidity, and early  mortality. Such outcomes impair quality of life and inflict a significant  socioeconomic burden. Predicting changes in SLE disease activity could allow for  closer monitoring and preemptive treatment, but existing clinical, demographic  and serologic markers have been only modestly predictive. Novel, proactive  approaches to clinical disease management are thus critically needed. Panels of  blood biomarkers can detect a breadth of immune pathway dysregulation that  captures SLE heterogeneity and disease activity. Alterations in the balance of  pro-inflammatory and regulatory soluble mediators have been associated with  changes in clinical disease activity and are detectable several weeks prior to  clinical flare occurrence. A soluble mediator score has been highly predictive of  impending flare in both European American and African American SLE patients, and  this score does not require a priori knowledge of specific pathway activation in  the patient. We review current concepts of disease activity and flare in SLE,  focusing on the potential of novel blood biomarkers to characterize and predict  changes in disease activity. Measuring the disordered immune response in SLE in  this way promises to improve disease management and prevent organ damage in SLE.

T1  - Safety considerations when using drugs in pregnant patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 523-536
AB  - Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) mainly affects young females  during childbearing age; therefore, reproductive issues are of major  interest.Areas covered: Pregnancy planning is crucial to adjust the treatment  toward drugs that are safe throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. The evidence  about drug safety is limited to post-marketing surveillance, registries, case  series, and case reports, as pregnant patients are excluded from randomized  clinical trials. The aim of this review is to report the safety considerations  when treating pregnant SLE patients. Regarding maternal side effects of drugs, we  focused on metabolic, infectious, and hemorrhagic complications. Fetal safety was  analyzed looking at drugs teratogenicity, their possible effects on immune  system, and on the long-term neuropsychological development of children.Expert  opinion: The management of pregnancy in SLE has changed when knowledge about the  safety of drugs has become available. Keeping SLE disease activity under control  before, during and after pregnancy is of fundamental importance to ensure the  best possible outcomes for mother and child. All these issues must be discussed  with the patient and her family during preconception counseling. International  efforts in terms of pregnancy registries and reproductive health guidelines help  physicians improve their communication with SLE patients.

AB  - Management of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), and obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) during pregnancy presents  unique clinical challenges. Women with both RA and SLE can have disease flares  during pregnancy, leading to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia,  small-for-gestational-age infants, and preterm delivery. Disease should be under  control prior to conception. Women with obstetric APS need to be anticoagulated  during pregnancy. Many but not all antirheumatic medications can be used during  pregnancy and lactation.

SP  - 575712
AB  - In the last two decades, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have aroused wide interest  among researchers in basic and clinical research. EVs, small membrane vesicles  are released by almost all kinds of cells into the extracellular environment.  According to many recent studies, EVs participate in immunomodulation and play an  important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. In addition, EVs have  great potential in the diagnosis and therapy of autoimmune diseases. Here, we  reviewed the latest research advances on the functions and mechanisms of EVs and  their roles in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis  and systemic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - Pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus anticoagulant 
SP  - 641-648
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lupus anticoagulant hypoprothrombinemia syndrome (LAHPS) is a rare  phenomenon that leads to concomitant thrombosis and hemorrhage in children with  SLE. LAHPS in pediatric SLE (pSLE) has a protracted course requiring long-term  immunosuppressive therapy. Due to the rarity of this syndrome and paucity of  reported cases, there is lack of standardized management. We herewith report 5  children with pSLE with LAHPS.Methodology: We retrospectively reviewed clinical  features, laboratory features, treatment and outcome for 5 children with lupus  anticoagulant hypoprothrombinemia syndrome with SLE and a review of literature of  similar cases published. RESULTS: Mean age of presentation was 10.2 +/- 2.38 years  (mean +/- SD) and female to male ratio was 4:1. All children presented with mild to  severe bleeding manifestations like gum bleed, epistaxis, hematuria, menorrhagia  and subarachnoid bleed. Coagulation profile revealed prolonged PT and aPTT, with  low prothrombin levels and positive Lupus anticoagulant in all children. Mixing  studies were characteristic in these children. On comparing laboratory parameters  majority had low C3, C4 levels, ANA and anti-DsDNA antibody positivity and three  children had anticardiolipin positivity. One child had lupus nephritis along with  LAHPS at presentation. All responded well to steroids and supportive measures.  CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion is needed when child with lupus presents with  bleeding manifestations for early diagnosis and treatment.

T1  - Hydroxychloroquine in the post-COVID-19 era: will this pandemic upset decades of 
SP  - 1649-1657
AB  - In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, Belgian health authorities endorsed  the interim guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia:  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) recommended for treatment of hospitalized patients with  moderate to severe disease. As a growing number of patients were admitted,  inevitably, our internal medicine team questioned the efficacy and safety of HCQ,  especially with regard to cardiac side effects. In parallel with our concerns,  data regarding the safety and efficacy of HCQ were published, with discordant  results and debate in the medical community. Media coverage of the possible risks  and benefits of HCQ use in COVID-19 also caused confusion amongst the public. In  this Perspectives in Rheumatology article, we review the use and safety of HCQ in  autoimmune disease and its putative efficacy and toxicity in COVID-19. Finally,  we share our concern about the future of this widely used and inexpensive drug  after the COVID-19 pandemic has passed.

T1  - Systematic review of safety and efficacy of belimumab in treating immune-mediated 
SP  - 2673-2683
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biologic agents (also termed biologics or biologicals) are becoming  increasingly important in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. However, the  diversity of clinical trials along with the fast pace of publication makes it  difficult to determine the level of evidence for the use of a biologic for a  given disorder. To address this challenge, we are publishing a series of  systematic reviews evaluating the safety and efficacy of B cell-targeting  biologics for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. In this article, we have  assessed the safety and efficacy of belimumab, a fully human IgG1 monoclonal  antibody targeting the cytokine B cell-activating factor (BAFF). OBJECTIVE: To  evaluate belimumab's safety and efficacy for the treatment of immune-mediated  disorders compared to placebo, conventional treatment or other biologics.  METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA) checklist guided the reporting of the data. We searched the PubMed  database between October 4, 2016, and June 23, 2019, concentrating on  immune-mediated disorders. RESULTS: The literature search identified 583  articles. After screening titles and abstracts against the inclusion and  exclusion criteria and assessing full texts, 17 articles were finally included in  a narrative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Belimumab is both safe and effective for the  treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. Results were further promising for the  use of belimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome.  Conversely, results using belimumab in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic  antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis and myasthenia gravis were rather  disappointing.

T1  - Treatment targets in SLE: remission and low disease activity state.
SP  - v19-v28
AB  - Treat-to-target strategies have changed the approach to management of many  chronic conditions, with improvements in patient outcomes. The key to success of  treat to target is the availability of validated treatment endpoints, which have  been difficult to derive for SLE, a condition notorious for its heterogeneity.  This review will focus on the development and validation of the definitions of  remission in SLE framework and the lupus low disease activity state. Lupus low  disease activity state is more attainable than remission, with a stepwise  concentric relationship between the target states indicating increasing  stringency. Both lupus low disease activity state and definitions of remission in  SLE remission have been proven to be associated with reduction in disease flares,  reduced risk of accrual of irreversible end organ damage, and improvement in  patient reported outcomes. These endpoints have therefore provided the key for  the development of a treat-to-target approach in clinical practice in SLE and for  the design of future clinical trials.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century.
SP  - v39-v51
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a frequent and severe manifestation of SLE. Along the  decades, the epidemiology of LN and its clinical presentation have been changing.  However, even though retrospective cohort studies report a decreased mortality  rate and an improvement in the disease prognosis, the percentage of patients  progressing into end stage renal disease (ESRD) keeps steady despite the  improvements in therapeutic strategies. Current in-use medications have been  available for decades now, yet over the years, regimens for optimizing their  efficacy and minimizing toxicity have been developed. Therapeutic research is now  moving towards the direction of precision medicine and several new drugs,  targeting selectively different pathogenetic pathways, are currently under  evaluation with promising results. In this review, we address the main changes  and persistent unmet needs in LN management throughout the past decades, with a  focus on prognosis and upcoming treatments.

SP  - v29-v38
AB  - SLE is a chronic autoimmune rheumatic disorder of high heterogeneity in clinical  presentation, treatment response and prognosis. Long-term outcomes in SLE have  been dramatically improved over the past decades, however, increased morbidity  and mortality, especially among young individuals, still exists. Unmet needs  include residual disease activity and frequent flares, glucocorticoid treatment  dependency and toxicity, comorbidity burden, reduced health-related quality of  life, health disparities and damage. The main determinants of long-term outcomes  in SLE are age, sex, race/ethnicity, genetic profile, environmental factors  including smoking, disease activity, major organ involvement such as lupus  nephritis and CNS involvement, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease and  serious infections, coexistence with APS, treatment adherence, socio-economic  factors and access to care. In this review we discuss trends in long-term  outcomes in SLE over the years and major contributors such as genetic,  disease-related, treatment, comorbidity, socio-economic and other factors.

T1  - Treating systemic lupus erythematosus in the 21st century: new drugs and new 
SP  - v69-v81
AB  - Besides treating acute flares, the management of SLE should aim at preventing  organ damage accrual and drug-associated harms, improving health-related quality  of life and prolonging survival. At present, therapy is based on combinations of  antimalarials (mainly HCQ), considered the backbone of SLE treatment,  glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. However, these regimens are not  universally effective and a substantial degree of damage can be caused by  exposure to glucocorticoids. In this review we provide a critical appraisal of  the efficacy and safety of available treatments as well as a brief discussion of  potentially novel compounds in patients with SLE. We emphasize the use of  methylprednisolone pulses for moderate-severe flares, followed by low-moderate  doses of oral prednisone with quick tapering to maintenance doses of </=5 mg/day,  as well as the prompt institution of immunosuppressive drugs in the setting of  severe disease but also as steroid-sparing agents. Indications for the use of  biologic agents, namely belimumab and rituximab, in refractory or  organ-threatening disease are also presented. We conclude by proposing evidence-  and experience-based treatment strategies tailored to the clinical scenario and  prevailing organ involvement that can aid clinicians in managing this complex  disease.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a lethal complication of different connective  tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease and  systemic lupus erythematosus. Although the treatment possibilities for patients  with pulmonary arterial hypertension have increased in the last two decades and  survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension has  improved, the latter is not the case for patients with pulmonary arterial  hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. In this narrative review,  we review recent literature and describe the improvement of early diagnostic  possibilities, screening modalities and treatment options. We also point out the  pitfalls in diagnosis in this patient category and describe the unmet needs and  what the focus of future research should be.

T1  - B-cell depletion or belimumab or voclosporin for lupus nephritis?
SP  - 237-244
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite ground-breaking innovations for most autoimmune  diseases, the treatment of lupus nephritis has remained largely the same for  decades because none of the tested drugs demonstrated superiority over  standard-of-care in randomized controlled clinical trials. RECENT FINDINGS:  Recently, the Belimumab in Subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus - Lupus  Nephritis trial tested belimumab, an inhibitor of B-cell activating factor, as an  add-on therapy to steroids and either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or  cyclophosphamide when given IV monthly over a period of 104 weeks at an effect  size of 11% for a Primary Efficacy Renal Response. The NOBILITY trial reported  positive results for the B-cell-depleting agent obinutuzumab as an add-on therapy  to steroids and MMF when given IV every 6 months over a period of 76 weeks at an  effect size of 22% for a complete renal response (CRR). The AURORA trial reported  positive results for the calcineurin inhibitor voclosporin as an oral add-on  therapy to low dose steroids and MMF when given twice daily over a period of 52  weeks at an effect size of 18.5% for a CRR. SUMMARY: These studies will change  the treatment landscape of lupus nephritis. In which way is discussed in this  article.

T1  - Management of Severe Refractory Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Real-World 
SP  - 17-30
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogeneous disease affecting  multiple organs and is characterized by an aberrant immune response. Although the  mortality of SLE has decreased significantly since the application of  glucocorticoids, severe or refractory SLE can potentially cause irreversible  organ damage and contribute to the disease morbidity and mortality. Early  recognition of severe SLE or life-threatening conditions is of great challenge to  clinicians since the onset symptoms can be rapid and aggressive, involving the  visceral organs of the neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, hematologic, renal,  pulmonary, and cardiovascular systems, etc. Additionally, SLE patients with  specific comorbidities and detrimental complications could lead to a clinical  dilemma and contribute to poor prognosis. Prompt and adequate treatment for  severe refractory SLE is crucial for a better prognosis. However, as evidence  from well-designed randomized controlled trials is limited, this review aims to  provide real-world evidence based on cohort studies from Peking Union Medical  College Hospital, the national tertiary referral center in China, together with  the literature, on clinical characteristics, risks and prognostic factors, and  treatment strategies for severe and/or refractory SLE.

T1  - Acquired hemophilia A in a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus: A case report 
SP  - e22926
AB  - RATIONALE: Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare autoimmune disease caused by  autoantibodies directed against the activity of factor VIII (FVIII) and presents  with prolonged bleeding. 5.7% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients are  affected by AHA. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 51-year-old female patient with SLE  presenting with the fatigue and spontaneous clinical bleeding symptoms such as  hematuria and ecchymoses for 1 week. DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examinations revealed  prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (65.7 s),  decreased FVIII activity (1.4%), and a titer of FVIII inhibitors of 8.5 Bethesda  units/mL. INTERVENTIONS: Transfusion of recombinant human FVIII (ADVATE) in  combination with intravenous methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide,  plasmapheresis, and fresh frozen plasma successfully stopped the bleeding and  reduced the level of FVIII inhibitor. OUTCOMES: The size of the hematoma slowly  decreased. The skin ecchymosis was gradually absorbed, the hemoglobin count  increased, and the coagulation index gradually improved. There was no new  bleeding or bleeding site. The patient was discharged and transferred to a local  hospital for hospice care. LESSONS: AHA in a patient with SLE is rare. Once it  occurs, it can be life-threatening. Clinicians should remain aware that because  some cases of AHA may have features of SLE, appropriate distinction and diagnosis  of these different but associated diseases is necessary.

T1  - Autoimmune Hypophysitis With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A Case Report and 
SP  - 579436
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoimmune hypophysitis (AH) is a primary autoimmune inflammatory  disorder of the pituitary gland, which usually presents as a mass in the sella  turcica. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another inflammatory disorder in  which the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues throughout the body.  Although both diseases are autoimmune disorders, they rarely coexist, and the  relationship between them is unclear. CASE REPORT: A 66-year-old man was  evaluated at the endocrinology clinic because of worsening fatigue, anorexia,  drowsiness, and leg oedema. Examination revealed alertness impairment and lower  limb oedema. Laboratory tests showed anterior pituitary hypofunction. The  treatment approach, with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, resulted  in long-term remission of symptoms of hypopituitarism and hyponatraemia.  CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates a potential association between AH and SLE. AH  may need to be considered in the evaluation of SLE patients with headache,  hyperprolactinemia, a pituitary mass, and hypopituitarism.

T1  - Sphingolipids and Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Organ Damage in Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 586737
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that involves  multiple organs and disproportionality affects females, especially African  Americans from 15 to 44 years of age. SLE can lead to end organ damage including  kidneys, lungs, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric systems, with cardiovascular  complications being the primary cause of death. Usually, SLE is diagnosed and its  activity is assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity  Index (SLEDAI), Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Damage Index  (SLICC/ACR), and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Scales, which  unfortunately often occurs after a certain degree of systemic involvements,  disease activity or organ damage already exists. There is certainly a need for  the identification of early biomarkers to diagnose and assess disease activity as  well as to evaluate disease prognosis and response to treatment earlier in the  course of the disease. Here we review advancements made in the area of  sphingolipidomics as a diagnostic/prognostic tool for SLE and its co-morbidities.  We also discuss recent reports on differential sphingolipid metabolism and blood  sphingolipid profiles in SLE-prone animal models as well as in diverse cohorts of  SLE patients. In addition, we address targeting sphingolipids and their  metabolism as a method of treating SLE and some of its complications. Although  such treatments have already shown promise in preventing organ-specific pathology  caused by SLE, further investigational studies and clinical trials are warranted.

SP  - 134-140
AB  - Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition with a  wide spectrum of clinical manifestations encompassing most organs and systems.  Its treatment approach includes different immunomodulatory treatments, of which  B-cell targeted therapies are part of. Rituximab (an anti-CD20 antibody) had  encouraging results in observational studies but failed when tested in clinical  trials. It is theorized that this could have been partially due to BAFF  upregulation, leading to rituximab failure. Therefore, targeting BAFF with  belimumab after rituximab therapy, may have a synergic effect in SLE. Objective:  We review the available observational data regarding sequential  rituximab/belimumab therapy in SLE patients. Results: Twenty-four patients from 6  studies were included. The results suggest a benefit with this combined therapy,  with reduction of the mean SLEDAI. However, there was significant drug regimen  and patient selection heterogeneity. Conclusion: Further randomized clinical  trials are needed to examine this drug sequencing protocol in SLE patients.

T1  - The Emerging Role of Renal Tubular Epithelial Cells in the Immunological 
SP  - 578952
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic, autoimmune disease that can  involve virtually any organ of the body. Lupus nephritis (LN), the clinical  manifestation of this disease in the kidney, is one of the most common and severe  outcomes of SLE. Although a key pathological hallmark of LN is glomerular  inflammation and damage, tubulointerstitial lesions have been recognized as an  important component in the pathology of LN. Renal tubular epithelial cells are  resident cells in the tubulointerstitium that have been shown to play crucial  roles in various acute and chronic kidney diseases. In this context, recent  progress has been made in examining the functional role of tubular epithelial  cells in LN pathogenesis. This review summarizes recent advances in our  understanding of renal tubular epithelial cells in LN, the potential role of  tubular epithelial cells as biomarkers in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment  of LN, and the future therapeutic potential of targeting the tubulointerstitium  for the treatment of patients with LN.

T1  - Clinical features of new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy in 
SP  - 2121-2131
AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the clinical features and pregnancy outcomes  of Chinese patients with new-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during  pregnancy or puerperium. We retrospectively evaluated the data of all pregnant  women with SLE managed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University  between April 2013 and March 2017. Clinical characteristics, laboratory features,  medication use, and pregnancy outcomes were compared between pregnant women with  new-onset SLE and pregnant women with pre-existing SLE. Risk factors for adverse  pregnancy outcomes were determined using binary regression analyses. Overall, 223  pregnancies in 216 patients were included; 148 (69.6%) patients had a history of  SLE, and 68 (30.4%) were diagnosed with SLE during pregnancy or puerperium. Most  cases of new-onset SLE (72.1%) occurred during the first and second trimesters.  Thrombocytopaenia (especially severe thrombocytopaenia) (76.5% vs 54.2%,  P = 0.008; 39.7% vs 15.5%, P = 0.001) and anaemia (especially moderate anaemia)  (73.5% vs 56.9%, P = 0.007; 52.9% vs 35.2%, P = 0.035) were more common in women  with new-onset SLE than in women with pre-existing SLE and active disease during  pregnancy. Additionally, patients with new-onset SLE experienced higher rates of  moderate-to-severe disease activity than patients with pre-existing SLE  (P < 0.01); disease activity occurred mostly during the first and second  trimesters (75.4%). Compared with pre-existing SLE patients, disease activity in  new-onset SLE patients occurred mostly in the first trimester (33.3% vs 15.3%,  P = 0.043) and less in the third trimester (21.1% vs 47.2%, P < 0.001). Pregnancy  loss was significantly higher in patients with new-onset SLE than in patients  with pre-existing SLE (62.4% vs 27.1%, P < 0.001), with most cases occurring  during the first and second trimesters (95.3%). However, there were no  significant differences in neonatal outcomes between new-onset and pre-existing  SLE patients with active disease. Within the new-onset SLE group, active disease  was an independent risk factor for pregnancy loss (odds ratio [OR] = 16.185,  confidence interval [CI] = 1.895-138.232, P = 0.011), whereas disease onset at  late gestation was a protective factor against pregnancy loss (OR = 0.589,  CI = 0.435-0.796, P = 0.013). Patients with new-onset SLE suffered greater  haematological involvement (mainly thrombocytopaenia and anaemia) and higher  rates of moderate-to-severe disease activity and pregnancy loss than patients  with pre-existing SLE. Controlling disease activity and extending gestational age  may improve pregnancy outcomes in women with new-onset SLE. Key Points * The  clinical features of new-onset SLE during pregnancy and its impact on pregnancy  outcomes have rarely been reported, especially in Chinese patients. * New-onset  SLE during pregnancy in Chinese women occurred primarily during the first and  second trimesters and was characterised by haematological disorders, including  thrombocytopaenia and anaemia. * Women with new-onset SLE during pregnancy had  significantly higher disease activity scores and pregnancy loss rates than women  with pre-existing SLE, especially during the first and second trimesters;  controlling disease activity and prolonging gestational age may improve pregnancy  outcomes in this setting.

T1  - EULAR recommendations for a core data set for pregnancy registries in 
SP  - 49-56
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is an urgent need for robust data on the  trajectories and outcomes of pregnancies in women with inflammatory rheumatic  diseases (IRD). In particular when rare outcomes or rare diseases are to be  investigated, collaborative approaches are required. However, joint data analyses  are often limited by the heterogeneity of the different data sources.To  facilitate future research collaboration, a European League Against Rheumatism  (EULAR) Task Force defined a core data set with a minimum of items to be  collected by pregnancy registries in rheumatology covering the period of  pregnancy and the 28-day neonatal phase in women with any underlying IRD.  METHODS: A stepwise process included a two-round Delphi survey and a face-to-face  meeting to achieve consensus about relevant items. RESULTS: A total of 64  multidisciplinary stakeholders from 14 different countries participated in the  two rounds of the Delphi process. During the following face-to-face meeting of  the EULAR Task Force, consensus was reached on 51 main items covering 'maternal  information', 'pregnancy' and 'treatment'. Generic instruments for assessment are  recommended for every item. Furthermore, for the five most frequent IRDs  rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic  lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue diseases, disease-specific  laboratory markers and disease activity measurements are proposed. CONCLUSION:  This is the first consensus-based core data set for prospective pregnancy  registries in rheumatology. Its purpose is to stimulate and facilitate  multinational collaborations that aim to increase the knowledge about pregnancy  course and safety of treatment in women with IRDs during pregnancy.

T1  - Update omicronn the diagnosis and management of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 14-25
AB  - Clinical heterogeneity, unpredictable course and flares are characteristics of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although SLE is-by and large-a systemic  disease, occasionally it can be organ-dominant, posing diagnostic challenges. To  date, diagnosis of SLE remains clinical with a few cases being negative for  serologic tests. Diagnostic criteria are not available and classification  criteria are often used for diagnosis, yet with significant caveats. Newer sets  of criteria (European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of  Rheumatology (ACR) 2019) enable earlier and more accurate classification of SLE.  Several disease endotypes have been recognised over the years. There is increased  recognition of milder cases at presentation, but almost half of them progress  overtime to more severe disease. Approximately 70% of patients follow a  relapsing-remitting course, the remaining divided equally between a prolonged  remission and a persistently active disease. Treatment goals include long-term  patient survival, prevention of flares and organ damage, and optimisation of  health-related quality of life. For organ-threatening or life-threatening SLE,  treatment usually includes an initial period of high-intensity immunosuppressive  therapy to control disease activity, followed by a longer period of less  intensive therapy to consolidate response and prevent relapses. Management of  disease-related and treatment-related comorbidities, especially infections and  atherosclerosis, is of paramount importance. New disease-modifying conventional  and biologic agents-used alone, in combination or sequentially-have improved  rates of achieving both short-term and long-term treatment goals, including  minimisation of glucocorticoid use.

T1  - Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 961-965
AB  - Surgical treatment of coronary artery disease in the systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) patients has not been comprehensively addressed. The present review aimed  to give an overview of coronary artery disease in the SLE patients receiving  coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study materials were based on  comprehensive literature retrieval, which recruited 17 pertinent articles with 30  patients. No differences were found in the graft patencies between the arterial  and venous grafts; and between the early and late patency rates. Pathological  inspections revealed that all graft vessels were normal with no signs of  SLE-related atherosclerosis or vasculitis, one coronary artery was pathologically  normal, and another coronary artery showed vasculitis. The coexisting disorders,  including diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and nephropathy in the SLE patients  cause early deterioration of the saphenous vein grafts. Early occlusion of the  saphenous vein grafts was also observed in SLE patients. The left anterior  descending coronary artery was most commonly affected by SLE and was the most  common coronary artery requiring a CABG procedure. The graft vessels, both  arterial and venous, rarely degenerated; whereas, early and late graft failure  was usually caused by technical failures. The lack of vasculitis and  atherosclerosis in the arterial grafts encourage surgeons to prefer to use the  arterial grafts in SLE patients. Less invasive surgical technique would favour  the patients in terms of long-term outcomes. Key Words: Coronary artery bypass  grafting, Graft occlusion, Vascular, Systemic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - Biologics in the treatment of Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
SP  - 609-616
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is an understatement to say that drug approvals in systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis, and Sjogren's syndrome have lagged  far behind those in other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and  psoriatic arthritis. Reasons for this are multiple and include the molecular and  clinical heterogeneity of these conditions; confounding by background  medications, especially corticosteroids; and clinical trial endpoints. However,  the tides are changing, and there have been several bright spots in our attempts  to bring more efficacious drugs to our patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Several  positive phase II and phase III trials in SLE and lupus nephritis with drugs such  as anifrolumab, voclosporin, belimumab, and obinutuzumab will no doubt eventually  generate regulatory approvals for most, if not all, of these drugs. Although  early in development, the promising results in Sjogren's syndrome with iscalimab  and ianalumab should make the Sjogren's syndrome community quite hopeful of  future drug approvals. SUMMARY: In this review, we highlight recent study results  in Sjogren's syndrome, SLE, and lupus nephritis, emphasizing investigational  therapies in late stage development, but we also provide a glimpse into drugs of  the future.

T1  - Prevalence, Predictors, and Prognostic Benefits of Remission Achievement in 
SP  - 208-218
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and evaluate the prevalence, potential  predictors, and prognostic benefits of remission achievement in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Studies reporting on the prevalence,  predictors, and prognostic benefits of remission in adult patients with SLE were  searched and selected from PubMed and Embase databases. Studies were reviewed for  relevance and quality. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies and  extracted data. RESULTS: Data from 41 studies including 17,270 patients were  included and analyzed. Although no consensus has been achieved on the definition  of remission, clinical disease activity, serologic activity, duration, and  treatment are agreed to be critical components of defining remission status. In  most studies published in the recent 5 years, 42.4-88% of patients achieved and  maintained the remission status for 1 year, and 21.1-70% did so for at least  5 years. Factors associated with remission included older age at diagnosis, lower  baseline disease activity, and absence of major organ involvement, while positive  serologic results were shown to be negatively associated with remission.  Remission (especially prolonged remission) when achieved, demonstrated an  association with lower accrual of damage and better quality of life among  patients with SLE. CONCLUSION: Remission is an achievable and desirable target  for SLE patients and proven to be associated with prognostic benefits. Further  development and assessment of a clear remission definition, a risk stratification  model, as well as a full algorithm with frequency of monitoring time points for  treatment adjustment and drug withdrawal are required.

T1  - Clinical characteristics and risk factors of infection in patients with systemic 
SP  - 1022-1039
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. We conducted a systematic review and  meta-analysis to investigate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of  infection in SLE by comparing demographic factors, laboratory data, clinical  features, and therapeutic factors between infection and non-infection SLE  patients. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched  systematically without restricting the language or year (up to September 2019) by  using MeSH terms and keywords pertaining to SLE and infection. Three independent  reviewers selected all observational studies based on the established inclusion  criteria. Odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) along with 95%  confidence intervals (CI) were used and the analyses were carried out by using a  random/fixed-effects model. When necessary, different subgroup and sensitivity  analyses were conducted. Study quality was assessed by the modified version  (nine-star scoring system) of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and publication  bias was evaluated by funnel plots, and Egger's and Begg's tests. RESULTS: In  total, we included 39 studies (3709 infection SLE patients and 10526  non-infection SLE patients) based on the inclusion criteria. Compared with the  SLE patients without infection, we found that infected SLE patients had a  significantly higher incidence rate of the following: 1) lymphopenia (OR = 2.738  95%CI (1.017-7.376), P = 0.046, I(2) = 81.4%), 2) thrombocytopenia (OR = 1.61  95%CI (1.4-1.85), P<0.001, I(2) = 0%), 3) anemia (OR = 2.294 95%CI (1.402-3.755),  P = 0.001, I(2) = 83.0%), 4) hypoproteinemia (OR = 2.336 95%CI (1.408-3.876),  P = 0.001, I(2) = 84.2%), 5) C3 consumed (OR = 1.890 95%CI (1.190-3.002),  P = 0.007, I(2) = 77.4%), 6) diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.890 95%CI (2.450-6.160),  P < 0.001, I(2) = 0%), 7) elevated creatinine (OR = 1.954 95%CI (1.646-2.320),  P < 0.001, I(2) = 0.0%), 8) renal involvement (OR = 2.692 95%CI (2.000-3.623),  P < 0.001, I(2) = 76.0%), 9) serositis (OR = 3.877 95%CI (0.995-15.110),  P = 0.051, I(2) = 79.1%), and 10) use of steroid immunosuppressants (OR = 3.116  95%CI (1.959-4.957), P < 0.001, I(2) = 77.9%). Furthermore, infected SLE patients  had a significantly higher mean dose of prednisone (SMD = 2.088 95%CI  (1.196-2.981), P < 0.001, I(2) = 97.8%). In addition, SLE patients with infection  showed a significantly lower incidence of antimalarial drug use (OR = 0.634 95%CI  (0.451-0.892), P = 0.009, I(2) = 56.0%). Infected SLE patients had a  significantly higher level of 1) 24-h urinary protein (SMD = 0.560 95%CI  (0.300-0.810), P < 0.001, I(2) = 0%), 2) CRP (SMD = 0.437 95%CI (0.184-0.691),  P = 0.001, I(2) = 68.6%), and 3) SLE Collaborating Clinics damage index (SDI)  (SMD = 0.451 95%CI (0.238-0.664), P < 0.001, I(2) = 0.0%), along with a  significantly lower level of albumin (SMD = -0.400 95%CI (-0.610--0.200),  P < 0.001, I(2) = 0.0%). After adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR),  lymphopenia and serositis were no longer associated with the occurrence of  infection; however, the remaining factors were still associated with infection in  SLE. According to the nine-star scoring system of NOS, 71.79% of the studies were  considered as high methodological quality (low risk of bias). No significant  publication bias, except for renal involvement, was detected from funnel plots or  Egger's and Begg's test, while this publication bias of renal involvement did not  impact the pooled estimates. CONCLUSION: We identified many factors including  thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypocomplementemia, hypoalbuminemia,  higher level of CRP, higher SDI score, renal involvement and diabetes mellitus  that were associated with infection in SLE patients. In addition, glucocorticoids  (especially high-dose) and immunosuppressants (e.g. cyclophosphamide) rendered  SLE patients more susceptible to infection, while antimalarial drug  administration (hydroxychloroquine) was a protective factor against infection in  SLE patients. SLE patients with the above clinical characteristics and risk  factors might be at high risk from infection, which might contribute to the early  identification of infection in SLE patients for better prognosis.

T1  - Pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1115-1125
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic illness that often  affects women of reproductive age. The objectives of this article are to review  the impact of SLE on pregnancy and current management strategies, including  commonly used therapies. METHODS: We conducted a review of available literature  on the clinical course of SLE, diagnosis, management and pregnancy complications.  RESULTS: SLE has a variable clinical course characterized by flares and periods  of remission and can present unique challenges in the management of obstetric  patients. Pregnancy in patients with SLE is associated with multiple risks,  including fetal loss, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and hypertensive  disease. With advancements in disease treatment, many women have favorable  pregnancy outcomes, but appropriate preconception counseling and disease  management remain important tools in reducing complications. CONCLUSION: Given  the implications SLE can have on women of reproductive age and in pregnancy,  understanding the disease course and management is important in order to optimize  pregnancy outcomes.

T1  - Extracellular vesicles and lupus nephritis 
SP  - 102540
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a major cause for overall morbidity and mortality in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), while its pathogenic mechanisms  are still not well understood. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane vesicles  that are released from almost all cell types. EVs can be subdivided into  exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. Latest studies have shown that EVs  can be released during several cellular events, including cell activation,  autophagy, and several types of programed cell death, i.e. apoptosis,  necroptosis, pyroptosis, and NETosis. Emerging evidence demonstrates that EVs  harbor different bioactive molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids,  cytokines, immune complexes (ICs), complements, and other molecules, some of  which may contribute to pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. EVs can serve as  novel information shuttle to mediate local autocrine or paracrine signals to  nearby cells, and distant endocrine signals to cells located far away. In LN, EVs  may have pathogenic effects by transportation of autoantigens or complements,  promotion of IC deposition or complement activation, and stimulation of  inflammatory responses, renal tissue injury, or microthrombus formation.  Additionally, EVs released from kidney cells may serve as specific biomarkers for  diagnosis or monitoring of disease activity and therapeutic efficacy. In this  review, we will summarize the latest progress about EV generation from basic  research, their potential pathologic effects on LN, and their clinical  implications. The cutting-edge knowledge about EV research provides insights into  novel therapeutic strategy, new tools for diagnosis or prognosis, and evaluation  approaches for treatment effectiveness in LN.

T1  - Update on antimalarials and systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 572-582
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is highlighting the most recent  evidence on the clinical efficacy and toxicity of antimalarials in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). RECENT FINDINGS: New data confirm the effects of  antimalarials in preventing SLE activity, damage and infections and in decreasing  mortality. An important reduction in use of health resources is related to  continued antimalarial use. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) may prevent preeclampsia in  pregnant women with SLE. HCQ ocular toxicity is infrequent and could be  associated with blood levels. Gastrointestinal and skin toxicity are  underrecognized and could influence adherence. Prolongation of QT interval is  extremely unusual with HCQ. Doses of HCQ of 200 mg/day seem to offer a good  efficacy/toxicity balance. HCQ protection against herpes zoster and Pneumocystis  jirovecii infection has been shown. On the contrary, HCQ prescription by doctors  and adherence by patients are both under recommended standards. The recent  coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a significant shortage of HCQ  in many countries with possible consequences in the correct treatment of lupus  patients. SUMMARY: Recent evidence reinforces the central role of HCQ in SLE  therapy. The reduction in activity, damage accrual and mortality is consistent  across studies, countries and ethnical groups. On the contrary, and despite the  well established beneficial effects of prolonged regular HCQ therapy, many SLE  patients do never take this drug or it is eventually stopped in the setting of  severe flares, pregnancy or presumed toxicity. Every effort must be made to  assure the correct prescription of HCQ and not to withdraw the drug unless  unequivocal signs of toxicity are present.

T1  - Biologic therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus: where are we now?
SP  - 597-608
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Conventional approaches using hydroxychloroquine,  corticosteroids and immunosuppressives have improved the prognosis for systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. Unfortunately, they have reached the limits  of what they can achieve and patients still die prematurely and/or find their  quality of life greatly impaired. Here, we discuss the problems of assessing  activity in SLE, optimizing clinical trial design and more recent biologic  approaches. RECENT FINDINGS: The success of B-cell depletion using Rituximab in  open clinical studies, the approval of Belimumab (blocks the B-cell activating  factor BAFF) and improvements in clinical trial design, gives cause for hope.  Approaches including the use of fully humanized anti-CD20 and CD19 monoclonals,  blocking interferons, inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), blocking the  CD40 ligand (CD40L), utilizing an analogue of the Fc[Latin Small Letter  Gamma]RIIB and an IL12-23 blocker and targeting the JAK-STAT pathway have met end  points in phase II and III trials. SUMMARY: For 20 years, we hoped that the  successes of the biologic therapies in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic  arthritis would be replicated in SLE but we have been generally disappointed.  However, the encouraging recent results with monoclonals that block interferon  and fully humanized anti-CD20 in particular, offer the prospect of a real  revolution in the treatment of SLE.

T1  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Targeted Literature Review of the Epidemiology, 
SP  - 187-198
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the epidemiology, current treatment, and disease burden  of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. METHODS:  A targeted literature review of published evidence on SLE in the APAC region was  conducted, using the Medline database (2008-2018), conference proceedings, and  other supplementary sources. RESULTS: The current review identified 70 studies  conducted in China (n = 15), Japan (n = 13), Taiwan (n = 12), Korea (n = 9),  Australia (n = 7), Hong Kong (n = 6), Singapore (n = 4), and multiple places  within the APAC region (n = 4). Incidence rates (per 100,000 persons per year)  ranged from 0.9-8.4, while prevalence rates ranged from 3.7-127 (per 100,000  persons); however, recent data were limited. Asian patients with SLE were  reported to have higher disease severity, disease activity (higher SLE disease  activity index scores), and organ damage accrual, along with increased morbidity,  mortality, and susceptibility to renal involvement compared with other  ethnicities in the APAC region. The risk of developing SLE is higher in the Asian  population. Routinely used SLE therapies included belimumab, hydroxychloroquine,  cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and  glucocorticoids; however, prescribing patterns varied across the region.  Increased disease activity was associated with high economic burden and poor  quality of life for SLE patients in the APAC region. CONCLUSION: SLE remains a  disease with a significant unmet medical need for an innovative therapy that is  well-tolerated and effective for patients in the APAC region. Further evidence is  required to better characterize the disease and fully capture the burden and  impact of SLE in the APAC region. This review has highlighted where there is a  paucity of data from patients across the APAC region.

T1  - Molecular Biomarkers in Multiple Sclerosis and Its Related Disorders: A Critical 
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the central  nervous system (CNS) which can lead to severe disability. Several diseases can  mimic the clinical manifestations of MS. This can often lead to a prolonged  period that involves numerous tests and investigations before a definitive  diagnosis is reached. As well as the possibility of misdiagnosis. Molecular  biomarkers can play a unique role in this regard. Molecular biomarkers offer a  unique view into the CNS disorders. They help us understand the pathophysiology  of disease as well as guiding our diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic  approaches in CNS disorders. This review highlights the most prominent molecular  biomarkers found in the literature with respect to MS and its related disorders.  Based on numerous recent clinical and experimental studies, we demonstrate that  several molecular biomarkers could very well aid us in differentiating MS from  its related disorders. The implications of this work will hopefully serve  clinicians and researchers alike, who regularly deal with MS and its related  disorders.

T1  - Anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody to the type I interferon receptor subunit 1, 
SP  - 1-12
AB  - Chronic activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway plays a critical role  in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Anifrolumab is a human  monoclonal antibody to the type I IFN receptor subunit 1, which blocks the action  of type I IFNs. Two phase 3 studies (TULIP-1 and TULIP-2) and a phase 2b study  (MUSE) provide substantial evidence for the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab  for moderately to severely active SLE. In all three studies, monthly intravenous  anifrolumab 300 mg was associated with treatment differences >16% compared with  placebo at Week 52 in British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus  Assessment response rates. The combined data across a range of other clinically  significant endpoints (e.g. oral corticosteroid reduction, improved skin disease,  flare reduction) further support the efficacy of anifrolumab for SLE treatment.  The safety profile of anifrolumab was generally similar across all studies;  serious adverse events occurred in 8-16% and 16-19% of patients receiving  anifrolumab and placebo, respectively. Herpes zoster incidence was greater with  anifrolumab (</=7%) vs placebo (</=2%). Evidence from these clinical trials suggests  that in patients with active SLE, anifrolumab is superior to placebo in achieving  composite endpoints of disease activity response and oral corticosteroid  reduction.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus: year in review 2019.
SP  - 2189-2196
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with extreme  heterogeneity and potentially involvement of any organ or system. Numerous  unanswered questions and challenges in SLE always prompt further exploration. In  2019, great progress in various aspects of SLE emerged. Both the classification  criteria and management recommendation for SLE were updated. New promising  medications have been widely developed and tested, although subsequent clinical  studies are warranted. As an emerging number of most notable studies in SLE were  published in both clinical area and basic research in 2019, we aim to summarize  the highest quality data on SLE regarding novel insights of pathogenesis, updated  recommendations, hot-spot issues on clinical manifestations, new understanding of  disease prognosis, and most importantly, the therapeutic advances in SLE in this  review.

T1  - Immunosuppressive therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus associated peripheral 
SP  - 1509-1519
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peripheral neurologic manifestations may be associated with most of  the collagen vascular diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), yet  most of the times it is not clear what therapy should be prescribed. EULAR  recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus with  neuropsychiatric manifestations suggest the use of glucocorticoids and  immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of SLE associated peripheral  neuropathy (PN) (strength of statement A, category of evidence 1), however these  recommendations are based on studies that did not focus specifically on PN but  rather on neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE out of which only one was a  randomized controlled clinical trial that included 7 patients with peripheral  neuropathy. The objective of this systematic review is to determine whether the  pathogenic treatments (corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, intravenous  immunoglobulins, plasmapheresis) are effective for SLE associated PN. METHODS: We  searched MEDLINE for all the studies that included the pathogenic treatment of  SLE associated PN. The purpose was to identify randomized clinical trials, and in  the absence of these, we included observational studies and case reports or case  series. RESULTS: The search returned only retrospective case reports or case  series. Only one prospective study, a randomized controlled study, was focused on  neuropsychiatric SLE and included few patients with PN (7). Some studies reported  cases of PN responsive to glucocorticoids (GC), cyclophosphamide (CYC), rituximab  (RTX), azathioprine (AZA), plasmapheresis (PPH), intravenous immunoglobulin  (IVIG), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or different combinations of these  immunosuppressive agents, whereas others noticed effectiveness of sequential  treatments (i.e. administration of a therapeutic agent after another single agent  or a combination of agents had previously failed). Many studies did not mention  how the outcomes were objectively measured. CONCLUSIONS: There are no  interventional studies dedicated to the SLE associated PN, only retrospective  case reports or case series which not only did they show contradictory results,  but they also represent the lowest level of evidence. There is a strong need for  new analytical studies dedicated to SLE associated PN.Protocol registered with  PROSPERO (number CRD42019121748).

T1  - New insights into the progression from cutaneous lupus to systemic lupus 
SP  - 829-837
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Between 5 and 25% of patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus  (CLE) can progress to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) during the course of the  disease. There is no clear predictive guideline for the progression of CLE to  SLE. AREAS COVERED: Lupus erythematosus (LE), a chronic autoimmune disease, has a  wide spectrum of manifestations. On one side of the spectrum is CLE, in which  patients only display skin lesions. On the other side of the spectrum is SLE,  which develops severe systemic involvement. CLE has even been considered as a  separate entity from LE, while CLE is also proposed to be associated with SLE. In  this review, the authors will describe the relationship between CLE and SLE;  summarize the incidence, risk factors, systemic involvement, and management of  patients who transition to SLE. The literature search was conducted mainly  through PubMed from March to July 2020. EXPERT OPINION: The identification of  clinical characteristics and biomarkers in patients facing risk of developing SLE  and monitoring the disease on a regular basis are essential to promptly manage  and hopefully prevent transition to the systemic form.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus in the intensive care unit: a systematic review.
SP  - 1364-1376
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with heterogeneous  pathophysiologic mechanisms and diverse clinical manifestations. SLE is a  frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Multiple studies with  controversial findings on the causes, evolution and outcomes of ICU-admitted  patients with SLE have been published. The aim of this paper is to review the  literature reporting the clinical characteristics and outcomes, such as mortality  and associated factors, in such patients. Among the main causes of ICU admissions  are SLE disease activity, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and  infections. The main factors associated with mortality are a high Acute  Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score, the need for mechanical  ventilation, and vasoactive and inotropic agent use. Reported mortality rates are  18.4%-78.5%. Therefore, it is important to evaluate SLE disease severity for  optimizing clinical management and patient outcomes.

T1  - Management of lupus nephritis: a systematic literature review informing the 2019 
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the current evidence for the management of lupus nephritis  (LN) informing the 2019 update of the EULAR/European Renal Association-European  Dialysis and Transplant Association recommendations. METHODS: According to the  EULAR standardised operating procedures, a PubMed systematic literature review  was performed, from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2018. Since this was an  update of the 2012 recommendations, the final level of evidence (LoE) and grading  of recommendations considered the total body of evidence, including literature  prior to 2012. RESULTS: We identified 387 relevant articles. High-quality  randomised evidence supports the use of immunosuppressive treatment for class III  and class IV LN (LoE 1a), and moderate-level evidence supports the use of  immunosuppressive treatment for pure class V LN with nephrotic-range proteinuria  (LoE 2b). Treatment should aim for at least 25% reduction in proteinuria at  3 months, 50% at 6 months and complete renal response (<500-700 mg/day) at  12 months (LoE 2a-2b). High-quality evidence supports the use of mycophenolate  mofetil/mycophenolic acid (MMF/MPA) or low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (CY)  as initial treatment of active class III/IV LN (LoE 1a). Combination of  tacrolimus with MMF/MPA and high-dose CY are alternatives in specific  circumstances (LoE 1a). There is low-quality level evidence to guide optimal  duration of immunosuppression in LN (LoE 3). In end-stage kidney disease, all  methods of kidney replacement treatment can be used, with transplantation having  the most favourable outcomes (LoE 2b). CONCLUSIONS: There is high-quality  evidence to guide the initial and subsequent phases of class III/IV LN treatment,  but low-to-moderate quality evidence to guide treatment of class V LN, monitoring  and optimal duration of immunosuppression.

T1  - Lupus Aortitis Successfully Treated with Moderate-dose Glucocorticoids: A Case 
SP  - 2789-2795
AB  - Lupus aortitis is a rare and potentially life-threatening disorder. Previous  studies have reported the utility of high-dose systemic glucocorticoids or  surgery as the treatment, although there have been no related controlled trials.  We herein report a 49-year-old woman with a 35-year history of systemic lupus  erythematosus who was diagnosed with aortitis. Her symptoms and laboratory and  imaging abnormalities rapidly resolved upon the administration of moderate-dose  glucocorticoids. We subsequently performed a literature review of similar cases  to identify the appropriate treatment and discuss these cases. A study of further  cases will be needed to identify the characteristics of patients who would  benefit from moderate-dose glucocorticoid therapy.

AB  - The publication of the new ACR/EULAR classification criteria for systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and the revision of the EULAR recommendations for the  management of SLE last year include many important novelties that will change the  classification and care of lupus patients. This refers to both general basic  treatment principles and specific therapy recommendations. For example, SLE can  only be classified as such if antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are present,  independently of titer height and fluorescence pattern. If ANAs are detected,  lupus-specific symptoms and serological abnormalities are assessed and separately  scored. A score of 10 and more classifies an SLE patient as such. With regard to  the care of SLE patients, every therapeutic decision should follow a  treat-to-target approach with the aim of achieving remission. Aim is to ensure  long-term survival, reduce damage and improve quality of life. These goals are  achieved by early diagnosis, consistent therapy and regular evaluation of disease  activity. All patients should receive antimalarials in the absence of  contraindications. If the response is inadequate or in case of moderate to severe  organ manifestations, steroid pulses over a few days and the early use of  immunosuppressive drugs (IM) are recommended. With the inclusion of biologicals,  especially belimumab and rituximab, new substance classes made their way into the  recommendations.

T1  - Rituximab treatment for lupus nephritis: A systematic review.
SP  - E47-54
AB  - PURPOSE: We used the Cochrane systematic review to analyze the effectiveness and  safety of rituximab for lupus nephritis. METHODS: Systematic search was performed  among Cochrane clinical controlled trials database, MEDLINE, MEDLINE-IN-Process  and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang  database from the establishment of the database to February 2016. The  effectiveness and safety were evaluated in terms of the complete remission rate,  total remission rate, urinary protein, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease  Activity Index changes and adverse events rate. Data were analyzed by the Review  Manager Software version 5.3. RESULTS: Five RCTs that met the inclusion criteria,  including a total of 238 patients, were enrolled in our study. The results showed  that the complete remission rate in rituximab group was a significantly higher  than that of cyclophosphamide group. The difference between the two groups was  statistically significant (OR=2.80, 95%CI(1.08,7.26), P=0.03). But there was no  significant difference between the two groups in partial and total remission  rate. The complete remission rate, partial remission rate and total remission  rate in rituximab treatment group was similar compared with mycophenolate mofetil  group and rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide group. The adverse reaction  rate was also similar among the groups. CONCLUSION: The study systematically  analyzed the effectiveness and safety of rituximab for lupus nephritis, which  suggested that the complete remission rate of rituximab in the treatment of lupus  nephritis was a significantly higher than that of cyclophosphamide group, while  the effectiveness and safety was of no difference compared with cyclophosphamide  and mycophenolate mofetil.

T1  - Outcomes of pregnancy and associated factors in sub-Saharan African women with 
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To scope and summarise available literature on the outcomes of  pregnancy and associated factors in sub-Saharan African women with SLE. METHODS:  Electronic databases and reference lists of retrieved articles were searched to  identify relevant studies published from 1 January 2000 to 28 October 2019. Data  were combined through narrative synthesis. RESULTS: We included four studies  retrospectively reporting a total of 137 pregnancies in 102 women over a 26-year  period. Mean age at conception ranged from 27.2 to 39.9 years. Kidney damage, the  predominant organ manifestation before conception, was reported in 43 (42.2%)  patients. Ninety-seven (70.8%) pregnancies resulted in 98 live births. SLE flares  occurred in 44 (32.2%) pregnancies, mainly skin (20.4%) and renal (18.2%) flares.  Major adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) were preterm birth 38.8%, low birth  weight 29.8%, pregnancy loss 29.2% and pre-eclampsia 24.8%. The main factors  associated with APOs were nephritis and SLE flares. CONCLUSION: Over two-thirds  of pregnancies resulted in live birth in this cohort of sub-Saharan African women  with SLE. The main APOs and associated factors described in other parts of the  world are also seen in this region, but with high rates of APOs. A large  prospective multinational study is warranted for more compelling evidence.

T1  - Rituximab use as induction therapy for lupus nephritis: a systematic review.
SP  - 892-912
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rituximab (RTX) has important usage in rheumatoid arthritis and  vasculitis. There remains a need for more, better, and safer treatments for  patients with lupus nephritis (LN). RTX has been trialed in such patients without  definitive conclusions about its effectiveness. As a role for RTX has not been  clearly established for LN, we carried out a systematic review and analysis.  METHODS: We identified 31 studies of RTX for class I-VI LN, and assessed complete  renal response (CRR) and partial renal response (PRR) using criteria including  serum creatinine, proteinuria, and urinary sediment. Due to differences in the  pediatric presentation of the disease, studies focusing on pediatric patients  were excluded. RESULTS: One randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed superiority  of RTX+cyclophosphamide (CYC) versus CYC alone (64% vs. 21% CRR and 19% vs. 36%  PRR). Six prospective and retrospective studies utilizing RTX monotherapy found  66% CRR or PRR in all patients. Eleven studies that investigated RTX in  combination with CYC or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) also found 66% CRR or PRR in  all patients. In total, the CRR for Caucasian, East Asian, and Hispanic patients  were 77%, 38%, and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RTX appeared to benefit  certain LN patients, but most studies were not randomized or properly controlled,  were heterogeneous in design, subjects, and LN types, and were not comparable,  and must therefore be interpreted cautiously. RTX alone may not deplete B cells  sufficiently for the perturbations of LN. In addition, RTX may induce responses  differently among patients of different ethnic and racial backgrounds.  Furthermore, there were wide variations in the baseline characteristics of the  patients, namely LN class, time course of disease, age, and prior  immunosuppressive use. We suggest a prospective RCT in patients aged 18-65 years  with class IV LN. Ideally, the patients would not have received prior  immunosuppression and would better represent different ethnicities. The treatment  groups would be RTX, RTX+belimumab, CYC, and MMF groups, with pulse-dose steroids  during induction followed by maintenance steroids and MMF. The CRR and PRR would  be assessed at 12 and 24 months. This or a similar study might clarify RTX's role  in the treatment of LN.

T1  - Which is the best SLE activity index for clinical trials?
SP  - 20-28
AB  - Following the advent of molecular targeted drugs, a paradigm shift in treatment  similar to that in rheumatoid arthritis has been expected in the treatment of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but clinical trials for drugs that many  specialists believed to be effective have failed repeatedly. The causes are not  simple, but include the heterogeneity of SLE, inclusion criteria, lack of  appropriate disease activity measures, and relapse criteria. This review outlines  the disease activity indices used in SLE, discusses their advantages and  disadvantages, and describes the ideal activity index.

T1  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical outcomes comparison between 
SP  - 156
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regarding lupus disease activity, morbidity and survival, limited  literature concluded conflicting results when comparing hemodialysis versus  peritoneal dialysis as initial renal replacement therapies (RRT) prior to  transplantation, in lupus nephritis end-stage renal disease (LN-ESRD) patients.  This study was aimed to compare the risks of lupus flares, all-cause infections,  all-cause cardiovascular events, and mortality, between hemodialysis versus  peritoneal dialysis as initial RRT - modality before renal-transplant in LN-ESRD  patients, by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and  SCOPUS were searched for observational-studies comparing LN-ESRD -patients  undergoing hemodialysis (Group1) versus peritoneal-dialysis (Group 2) prior to  renal-transplantation, by their risks of lupus flare, all-cause infections,  all-cause cardiovascular events, and mortality as outcome measures.  Relative-Risks of outcomes between the groups measured overall effects at a 95%  significance level. RevMan 5.3 computer software was used for analysis. RESULTS:  From search, 16 eligible studies reported 15,636 LN-ESRD -patients prior to renal  transplantation with 4616 patients on hemodialysis, 2089 on peritoneal dialysis,  280 directly underwent kidney transplantation, 8319 were eliminated with reasons  and 332 participants' details were not reported. Hemodialysis group had higher  risk of all-cause cardiovascular events, Relative-Risk = 1.44 (Confidence  Interval:1.02, 2.04), p-Value< 0.05. With regards to risks for mortality, flare  and all-cause infections, there were trends that were not statistically  significant (p-Value> 0.05). CONCLUSION: Except for all-cause cardiovascular  events in which peritoneal dialysis is superior to hemodialysis offering better  outcomes, both treatment modalities offer more or less similar clinical outcomes  as effective initial choices of RRT in LN-ESRD patients prior to renal  transplant.

T1  - A review of fetal and neonatal consequences of maternal systemic lupus 
SP  - 1066-1076
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) primarily affects women of childbearing age  and is commonly seen in pregnancy. The physiologic and immunologic changes of  pregnancy may alter the course of SLE and impact maternal, fetal, and neonatal  health. Multidisciplinary counseling before and during pregnancy from  rheumatology, maternal fetal medicine, obstetrics, and pediatric cardiology is  critical. Transplacental passage of autoantibodies, present in about 40% of women  with SLE, can result in neonatal lupus (NL). NL can consist of usually permanent  cardiac manifestations, including conduction system and myocardial disease, as  well as transient cutaneous, hematologic, and hepatic manifestations.  Additionally, women with SLE are more likely to develop adverse pregnancy  outcomes such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth,  perhaps due to an underlying effect on placentation. This review describes the  impact of SLE on maternal and fetal health by trimester, beginning with  prepregnancy optimization of maternal health. This is followed by a discussion of  NL and the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of  anti-Ro/La mediated cardiac disease, as well as screening, treatment, and methods  for prevention. Finally discussed is the known increase in preeclampsia and fetal  growth issues in women with SLE that can lead to iatrogenic preterm delivery.

T1  - Anifrolumab in systemic lupus erythematosus: current knowledge and future 
SP  - 275-286
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is  potentially life-threatening and can affect any organ. The complex pathogenesis  and heterogeneity of the disease, among other factors, present significant  challenges in developing new therapies. Knowledge gained over many years has  implicated type I interferon (IFN) in the pathogenesis of SLE and anti-IFN  therapies hold promise as a much-needed future treatment for SLE. Anifrolumab, a  human monoclonal antibody against the type I IFN receptor, has recently been  evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of  moderate-to-severe SLE. Here, we review the clinical efficacy and safety of  anifrolumab and discuss the potential challenges in determining the optimal SLE  patient subgroup for treatment.

SP  - 359-366
AB  - Current research in the field of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and pregnancy  focuses on predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes, the safety and efficacy of  hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pregnancy and the importance of preconception  counselling. In particular, the prospective predictors of pregnancy outcome:  biomarkers in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and SLE (PROMISSE) study adds to  the understanding of risk factors for adverse outcomes. There is increasing  evidence of the numerous benefits associated with continuing HCQ treatment in  pregnancy and for the use of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of  preeclampsia. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has published  evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of women with SLE and/or  antiphospholipid syndrome before, during and after pregnancy. Rheumatologists  caring for women with SLE should be familiar with the current state of knowledge  in order to help optimize the management and thus the outcome of pregnancy in  their patients.

T1  - [Treat to target in systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 351-358
AB  - BACKGROUND: For the first time, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)  recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include  a treat to target (T2T) strategy, naming remission as the main target. The aim is  to improve the long-term survival, prevent damage and optimize the health-related  quality of life. Compared to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for which the T2T approach  is already widely used, establishing T2T in SLE remains challenging due to its  heterogeneity and limited treatment options. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article  is to outline the current status of the T2T concept for SLE and to identify  challenges and particularities. A special focus is placed on the use of activity  scores and the importance of steroids in targeted treatment of SLE. RESULTS AND  CONCLUSION: The use of T2T for SLE remains a challenge. With the definitions of  the lupus low disease activity states (LLDAS) and the definitions of remission in  SLE (DORIS) a big step forward has been taken on the road towards the ideal  treatment target; however, many aspects of the "treat" remain unclear. As an  example, due to a lack of data there are no explicit strategies for steroid  reduction although it is often mandatory to achieve the targets. The T2T also  includes much more than only immunosuppressive treatment and antimalarial agents,  as disease damage which has already occurred and damage due to drugs, concomitant  phenomena (such as depression) and comorbidities as well as measures for  secondary prophylaxis must also be included.

SP  - 232-240
AB  - Targeted treatment is a rheumatologist's dream, which, with the advent of  biologicals and more recently small molecules, has become true for rheumatoid  arthritis and is about to translate into reality for systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). Belimumab, the first biological approved for SLE, is now also available in  a subcutaneous formulation. It is notable that this drug achieved the primary  endpoint in four independent trials and demonstrated substantial reduction of  organ damage accrual. The B cell depletion with antibodies against CD20 remains  clinically relevant and of interest for future developments and the combination  of both approaches (belimumab and anti-CD20) is an exciting idea. Blockade of the  type I interferon receptor with anifrolumab was effective in a phase 3 trial and  blocking interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 with ustekinumab is currently being  tested in a phase 3 clinical trial. The old ideas of blocking tumor necrosis  factor (TNF) and interleukin‑6 have also not yet been forgotten. More novel  approaches comprise Janus kinase (Jak) inhibition with positive phase 2 data for  baricitinib and soon inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) as well as  proteasome inhibitors. The treatment of SLE could therefore soon become much more  varied.

T1  - Protecting the kidney in systemic lupus erythematosus: from diagnosis to therapy.
SP  - 255-267
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus  that can lead to irreversible renal impairment. Although the prognosis of LN has  improved substantially over the past 50 years, outcomes have plateaued in the USA  in the past 20 years as immunosuppressive therapies have failed to reverse  disease in more than half of treated patients. This failure might reflect disease  complexity and heterogeneity, as well as social and economic barriers to  health-care access that can delay intervention until after damage has already  occurred. LN progression is still poorly understood and involves multiple cell  types and both immune and non-immune mechanisms. Single-cell analysis of  intrinsic renal cells and infiltrating cells from patients with LN is a new  approach that will help to define the pathways of renal injury at a cellular  level. Although many new immune-modulating therapies are being tested in the  clinic, the development of therapies to improve regeneration of the injured  kidney and to prevent fibrosis requires a better understanding of the mechanisms  of LN progression. This mechanistic understanding, together with the development  of clinical measures to evaluate risk and detect early disease and better access  to expert health-care providers, should improve outcomes for patients with LN.

T1  - Prediction of prognosis and renal outcome in lupus nephritis.
SP  - e000389
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe manifestation of SLE, characterised by  subendothelial and/or subepithelial immune complex depositions in the afflicted  kidney, resulting in extensive injury and nephron loss during the acute phase and  eventually chronic irreversible damage and renal function impairment if not  treated effectively. The therapeutic management of LN has improved during the  last decades, but the imperative need for consensual outcome measures remains. In  order to design trials with success potentiality, it is important to define  clinically important short-term and long-term targets of therapeutic and  non-therapeutic intervention. While it is known that early response to treatment  is coupled with favourable renal outcomes, early predictors of renal function  impairment are lacking. The information gleaned from kidney biopsies may provide  important insights in this direction. Alas, baseline clinical and  histopathological information has not been shown to be informative. By contrast,  accumulating evidence of pronounced discrepancies between clinical and  histopathological outcomes after the initial phase of immunosuppression has  prompted investigations of the potential usefulness of per-protocol repeat kidney  biopsies as an integral part of treatment evaluation, including patients showing  adequate clinical response. This approach appears to have merit. Hopefully,  clinical, molecular or genetic markers that reliably reflect kidney  histopathology and portend the long-term prognosis will be identified. Novel  non-invasive imaging methods and employment of the evolving artificial  intelligence in pattern recognition may also be helpful towards these goals. The  molecular and cellular characterisation of SLE and LN will hopefully result in  novel therapeutic modalities, maybe new taxonomy perspectives, and ultimately  personalised management.

T1  - State-of-the-art treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 465-471
AB  - As glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs are non-specific therapeutic  agents that cause many adverse reactions, the development of biologicals aiming  to control specific molecular targets is anticipated for the treatment of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The antibody targeting B cell-activating  factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) belimumab was the  first biological approved for SLE. At present, many biologicals, such as  anifrolumab (anti-type I interferon receptor antibody) and ustekinumab (antibody  against interleukin 12/23 [p40]), are in clinical trials. Thus, successful  treatments with biologicals targeting "bridging cytokines" produced by dendritic  cells, which form a bridge between the innate and acquired immune/autoimmune  systems, is of particular interest. Moreover, a phase IIb clinical trial of  baricitinib, a low-molecular-weight compound targeting Janus kinase 1/2, in  patients with SLE revealed that baricitinib was significantly more effective for  relieving arthritis and skin manifestations than placebo, and the trial met the  primary endpoint. In the future, it is expected that drugs with better efficacy  and safety profiles will be used to apply therapeutic strategies, such as  precision medicine, in which different molecular target drugs are used for  patients classified by their conditions, and to set a therapeutic goal of the  discontinuation of glucocorticoids.

T1  - Pregnancy and lupus nephritis in developing countries: A systematic review.
SP  - 10-20
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN) have a significant  impact on the course of pregnancy, as well as on maternal and fetal outcomes. LN  in pregnancy can increase the maternal risks of SLE flare, acute kidney injury,  preeclampsia, and even death. It also affects fetal outcomes by the increased  risk of intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, and fetal loss.  Successful pregnancy outcomes have been well documented in the developed world,  but less is known about patients in developing nations. We searched PubMed and  Google scholar for all articles published from 1999 to 2016 in developing  countries. Twelve of 13 studies were included excluding only one. All studies  were independently reviewed. Most of the studies reported a significant  association between high flare rates of LN and higher rates of disease flare.  Higher rates of active disease at conception were associated with lower live  birth rates. Similarly, high flare rates of LN were associated with higher rates  of fetal loss. With regard to geographic trends, Indian studies reported lower  overall live birth rates and higher rates of active disease at conception.  Interestingly, lower rates of preeclampsia were also noted in Indian studies.  Higher rates of flare were observed in other Asian studies, but not the Indian  studies. Although LN and active SLE at conception are associated with poor fetal  outcomes, better outcomes are possible with proper management, even in  low-resource settings. More research is necessary to fully understand the  relationships between active disease at conception or LN and flare rates, live  birth rates, and fetal loss rates in developing countries.

T1  - Finding lupus in the ANA haystack.
SP  - e000384
AB  - Diagnosis of SLE in early stages is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature  of presenting symptoms and the poor performance metrics of the screening ANA  test. Even the more specific double-stranded DNA autoantibody has relatively low  predictive value in early disease. A consequence is delayed referral, with the  likelihood that some patients have progression of disease prior to specialist  evaluation. Tests that might fill this diagnostic gap are therefore needed. The  AVISE Connective Tissue Disease Test that uses a multiplex approach to detect  autoantibodies and cell-bound complement products has shown utility in  distinguishing SLE from other rheumatological conditions. Whether it might be  useful in early disease stages to predict progression is addressed in a recent  study by Liang and colleagues, who tested clinic patients who had non-specific  findings with the objective of determining whether AVISE could predict onset of  SLE. While this test provided more useful prognostic information than other  available diagnostics, it had relatively low sensitivity, suggesting that  significant numbers of patients with preclinical SLE would be missed by this  screening. The need remains for development of diagnostics with robust  sensitivity and specificity in early disease that would also deliver prognostic  information about risk for SLE. Such tests would have great value as a tool for  primary providers to more efficiently triage ANA-positive patients for  appropriate specialty evaluation.

T1  - Endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness in patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 55-63
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-invasive surrogates of cardiovascular (CV) disease such  as endothelial dysfunction (ED) and peripheral arterial stiffness (AS) have been  evaluated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The aim of this study  was to systematically review and meta-analyze reports of cardiovascular disease  (CVD) in SLE patients, as measured by ED and AS. METHODS: Studies analyzing the  relationship of SLE with ED (flow-mediated dilatation [FMD],  nitroglycerin-mediated dilatation [NMD] and peripheral arterial tonometry [PAT])  and AS (augmentation index [AIx], pulse wave velocity [PWV]) were systematically  searched for in PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, VHL, SciELO and Web of Science  databases. Inclusion criteria included peer-review and English language. Mean  differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the  random effect model. The study was registered with PROSPERO, number  CRD42019121068. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 49 studies. FMD data from 18  studies including 943 SLE subjects (mean age = 38.71 [95%CI 36.21, 41.21] years)  and 644 unaffected controls (mean age = 38.63 [95%CI 36.11, 41.15] years) were  included. When compared with unaffected controls, FMD in SLE subjects was  decreased by 4.3% (95%CI: -6.13%, -2.47%): p < 0.001). However, NMD did not  significantly differ between SLE patients and controls (MD = - 2.68%; 95% CI  -6.00, 0.62; p = 0.11). A significantly increased AS between SLE patients and  controls according to overall PWV (MD = 1.12 m/s; 95% CI 0.72-1.52; p < 0.001)  was observed, but not for the brachial-ankle PWV. AIx was also increased in SLE  patients compared with healthy controls (MD = 4.55%; 95% CI 1.48-7.63;  p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, SLE patients showed impaired FMD, an  independent predictor of CV events. There was a higher degree of AS in SLE  patients compared with controls. ED and AS in SLE should be considered when  planning preventive strategies and therapies.

T1  - Clinical Significance of Monitoring Hydroxychloroquine Levels in Patients With 
SP  - 707-716
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite the pivotal role that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plays in  treating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), less than 50% of patients take HCQ  as prescribed. Measurement of HCQ blood levels can help clinicians distinguish  nonadherence versus lack of efficacy of HCQ. Our objective was to systematically  review publications and perform a meta-analysis to examine the correlation  between HCQ levels and 1) nonadherence and 2) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores, in SLE. METHODS: A comprehensive search  was performed. We included observational and interventional studies that measured  HCQ levels and assessed adherence or SLEDAI scores in adults with SLE. Forest  plots compared pooled estimates of correlations between HCQ levels and reported  nonadherence or SLEDAI scores. RESULTS: Among 604 studies screened, 17 were  reviewed. We found 3-times higher odds of reported nonadherence in patients with  low HCQ levels (odds ratio 2.95 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.63, 5.35], P  < 0.001). The mean SLEDAI score was 3.14 points higher in groups with  below-threshold HCQ levels on a priori analysis (delta = 3.14 [95% CI -0.05, 6.23], P  = 0.053), and 1.4 points higher in groups with HCQ levels of <500 ng/ml (delta = 1.42  [95% CI 0.07, 2.76], P = 0.039). Among 1,223 patients, those with HCQ levels >/=750  ng/ml had a 58% lower risk of active disease, and their SLEDAI score was 3.2  points lower. CONCLUSION: We found a strong association between low HCQ levels  and reported nonadherence. Our results suggest that HCQ levels of >/=750 ng/ml  might be a potential therapeutic target.

T1  - Targeted Biologic Therapy for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Emerging Pathways and 
SP  - 133-147
AB  - Following the approval of belimumab, the first drug to be approved for systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) in over 50 years, advances in our understanding of the  pathogenesis of the disease have led to a remarkable number of clinical trials  for investigational drugs, each with a unique mechanism of action. These include,  but are not limited to, antibodies targeting B or T cells or their interaction,  dendritic cells, interferon, and other cytokines. Frustratingly, this boost of  studies has not been accompanied by a corresponding success and subsequent  approval of novel agents, for reasons only partly attributed to the efficacy of  the drugs per se. Successful phase II trials are often followed by failed phase  III studies, which typically require many more patients. Nevertheless, recent  successes, such as the ustekinumab and baricitinib trials and the positive  results from the phase III TULIP-2 study of anifrolumab, provide room for  cautious optimism. In this review, we attempt to draw the current landscape of  the drug pipeline in SLE, focusing on the rationale behind each drug development,  its mechanism of action, and the available preclinical and clinical data. We also  highlight lessons learned from failed attempts that have helped to optimize  clinical trial design for this challenging disease. We conclude with a look into  the future, commenting on the surge of studies in the field of biomarkers and the  use of omics technologies in lupus, which aim to pinpoint different disease  phenotypes and, ideally, identify subsets of patients with disease that will  respond to different biologic drugs.

T1  - Transplant outcomes in kidney recipients with lupus nephritis, and systematic 
SP  - 248-255
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite improved survival of patients with lupus nephritis (LN), some  require kidney transplantation because of progression to end-stage renal disease  (ESRD). However, the transplant outcomes of these patients and other recipients  have not been thoroughly compared. METHODS: In total, 1848 Korean kidney  recipients who underwent transplantation from 1998 to 2017 at two tertiary  referral centers were evaluated retrospectively. Among them, 28 recipients with  LN, and 50 control recipients matched by age, sex, and donor type, were compared  with respect to graft and patient survival. We pooled our data with 17 previous  cohort studies in which the graft survival of recipients with LN was described in  detail. RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 9.5 years (maximum 21  years), graft failure (GF) occurred in 10.7% and 16.0% of LN and control  recipients, respectively. No differences were found in the rates of GF and  death-censored graft failure or patient survival between the two groups. The  risks of acute T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated rejection were also similar  between the two groups. The pooled analysis showed similar 1- and 5-year graft  survival rates between LN and control recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney  transplantation is an acceptable option in patients with concurrent LN and ESRD.

SP  - 144-156
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to perform a standardized review of available mobile health  (mHealth) applications (apps) for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to  conduct a systematic review of the literature on mHealth technologies in SLE.  METHODS: Google Play and AppStore in the United States of America were queried  and the quality of eligible mHealth apps was assessed using the Mobile App Rating  Scale (MARS). Web of Science, EMBASE, Medline, and Cochrane databases were  systematically searched from inception through June 2019. RESULTS: Of 324 mHealth  apps found, 20 were eligible for inclusion; 10 focused on education, 7 offered  tools to track patient-reported symptoms, 5 included interactive online  communities, and 1 enabled emoji sharing. The reviewed apps scored poorly on the  MARS quality scale with a mean score 2.3 (0.6) out of 5. Of 1147 studies  identified in the literature review, 21 were eligible for inclusion; 11 studies  (52.4%) focused on the development and use of mHealth for providing patient  information, while only 2 (9.5%) were randomized trials of mHealth interventions.  CONCLUSIONS: Although there is growing interest in the development of mHealth  technologies to support SLE patients, currently available tools are of poor  quality and limited functionality, and the literature examining this area is  sparse.

T1  - Advances in the diagnosis, pathogenesis and treatment of neuropsychiatric 
SP  - 152-158
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diagnosing and treating neuropsychiatric systemic lupus  erythematosus (NPSLE) remains challenging as the pathogenesis is still being  debated. In this review, we discuss studies evaluating recent advances in  diagnostic methods, pathogenic mediators and potential treatments. RECENT  FINDINGS: Screening tools used for neurodegenerative diseases were found to be  both sensitive and moderately specific for cognitive dysfunction in NPSLE.  Neuroimaging can be used to distinguish systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  patients from healthy controls, but further refinement is needed to differentiate  between lupus patients with and without neuropsychiatric manifestations. Elevated  levels of specific molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid and/or serum, as well as  the presence of certain autoantibodies, have been identified as potential  biomarkers in attempts to facilitate a more accurate and objective diagnosis.  Among such autoantibodies, anti-NR2 and anti-ribosomal P autoantibodies also have  a pathogenic role, although newer studies demonstrate that blood-brain barrier  damage may not always be required as previously believed. These and other  observations, together with new evidence for disease attenuation after microglial  modulation, suggest direct involvement of the central nervous system in NPSLE  pathogenesis. SUMMARY: Neuropsychiatric involvement of SLE includes a variety of  symptoms that impact quality of life and patient prognosis. There have been  recent advances in improving the diagnosis of NPSLE as well as in dissecting the  underlying pathogenesis. The attenuation of neuropsychiatric disease in mouse  models demonstrates the potential for targeted therapies, which are based on a  clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of NPSLE. Further assessment of these  treatments is required in NPSLE patients, as well as the potential use of  neuroimaging to distinguish between SLE patients with or without neuropsychiatric  manifestations.

T1  - Cardiovascular Disease in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Recent Data on 
SP  - 549-565
AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is associated with increased risk for  accelerated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular (CV) events including coronary  heart disease, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery disease. CV events occur  both early and late during the disease course, with younger patients being at  much higher risk than age-matched counterparts. The risk cannot be fully  accounted for by the increased prevalence of traditional atherosclerotic factors  and may be due to pathophysiologic intermediates such as type I interferons and  other inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, activated granulocytes and  production of extracellular chromatin traps, antiphospholipid and other  autoantibodies causing dysfunction of lipoproteins, altogether resulting in  endothelial injury and pro-atherogenic dyslipidaemia. These mechanisms may be  further aggravated by chronic intake of prednisone (even at doses <7.5 mg/day),  whereas immunomodulatory drugs, especially hydroxychloroquine, may exert  antiatherogenic properties. To date, there is a paucity of randomized studies  regarding the effectiveness of preventative strategies and pharmacological  interventions specifically in patients with SLE. Nevertheless, both the European  League Against Rheumatism recommendations and extrapolated evidence from the  general population emphasize that SLE patients should undergo regular monitoring  for atherosclerotic risk factors and calculation of the 10-year CV risk. Risk  stratification should include diseaserelated factors and accordingly, general  (lifestyle modifications/smoking cessation, antihypertensive and statin  treatment, low-dose aspirin in selected cases) and SLE-specific (control of  disease activity, minimization of glucocorticoids, use of hydroxychloroquine)  preventive measures be applied as appropriate. Further studies will be required  regarding the use of non-invasive tools and biomarkers for CV assessment and of  risk-lowering strategies tailored to SLE.

T1  - Dendritic cells as key players in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 225-232
AB  - System lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting  multiple organs, and persistent disease activity is associated with increased  morbidity and mortality. Impairment of immune cell function and loss of immune  tolerance to self-antigens are significant determinants that trigger inflammation  and drive SLE pathogenesis. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent  antigen-presenting cells that serve as a critical link between innate and  adaptive immune system. SLE development and pathogenesis are associated with  aberrant regulation in homeostasis and function of DCs, therefore, DC-targeted  therapies have become of importance for treatment of SLE and autoimmune diseases.  This review focus on the significance of DCs in promoting of SLE pathogenesis,  and further discuss the clinical potential of DCs in SLE therapy. The insights on  the roles of DCs in SLE will provide the improvement of treatment strategy for  SLE patients.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Traditional risk models, such as the Framingham risk score,  fail to capture the increased cardiovascular disease risk seen in patients with  chronic inflammatory diseases. This review will cover imaging modalities and  their emerging applications in assessing subclinical cardiovascular disease for  both research and clinical care in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.  RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple imaging modalities have been studied to assess for  subclinical cardiovascular disease via functional/physiologic, inflammatory, and  anatomic assessment in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. The use of  imaging to evaluate subclinical cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic  inflammatory diseases has the potential to capture early sub-clinical  atherosclerosis, to improve risk stratification of future cardiovascular events,  and to guide effective disease management.

SP  - 363-384
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are  autoimmune diseases characterized by changes in cell adhesion molecules (CAMs).  OBJECTIVE: To review the influence of the main drugs used in the treatment of SLE  and RA on CAM levels. METHODS: A bibliographic search was performed using  electronic databases. The research included human studies, in vivo or in vitro,  with an experimental or observational design, and with no limit of publication  date or number of subjects. Animal studies and non-standard treatments were not  considered. RESULTS: We included 21 studies, 3 on SLE and 18 on RA with  monotherapy or combined trials. The most used drugs were cyclophosphamide (CY, in  2 studies) and methylprednisolone pulse (pMP, n = 2) in SLE; and methotrexate  (MTX, n = 9) and infliximab (IFX, n = 4) in RA. In addition, the most frequently  examined CAMs to predict response to treatment were vascular cell adhesion  molecule-1 (VCAM-1, n = 2) in SLE, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1,  n = 12), VCAM-1 (n = 12), and E-selectin (n = 14) in RA. After treatment, CAM  levels were decreased in SLE and RA patients with active disease. CONCLUSIONS: It  is concluded that the CAM biomarkers may reflect disease activity and the  response to treatment in SLE and RA patients.

T1  - Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and 
SP  - 84-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as a sudden loss  of hearing, usually unilateral, of more than 30 dB in 3 contiguous frequencies of  the tonal audiometry. SSNHL estimates an incidence ranging from 5 to 20 per  100.000 people per year. In approximately 75% of cases, a cause cannot be  identified. However, it could be a clinical manifestation of Systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS). OBJECTIVE: This review  will focus on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of the SLE and  APS associated SSNHL. METHODS: We searched in PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs, and  Cochrane reviewing reports of Sudden sensorineural hearing loss in SLE and/or  APS. Articles written in English and Spanish, and were available in full text,  were included. RESULTS: In patients with SLE, bilateral involvement was frequent.  Antiphospholipid antibodies were positive in the majority of the patients.  Corticosteroids were the mainstay of the treatment. The auditory prognosis was  poor with total hearing loss recovery reached in only 22% of patients. On the  other hand, most of the patients with SSNHL and APS were males and presented  associated symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus and/or headache, 75% had bilateral  disease. Lupus anticoagulant and aCL were found in equal proportions, all  patients were anticoagulated, and aspirin was associated in 25% of the cases.  Complete resolution or improvement of symptoms was observed in 25% of the  patients. CONCLUSION: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss, can be a clinical  feature of SLE and APS. Treating physicians should be aware of this devastating  complication, especially when bilateral involvement occurs.

SP  - 461
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have recognized 15 children with jSLE and the antecedent of IgA  vasculitis (HSP). This association is not broadly present in the literature. AIM:  To know the age and gender distribution of children with IgA vasculitis (HSP),  compare it to our IgA vasculitis (HSP) + jSLE cases, and identify prognostic  factors to develop jSLE within our case series, IgA vasculitis (HSP) vs. IgA  vasculitis (HSP) + jSLE. METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to know the  age and gender distribution of children with IgA vasculitis (HSP). The  information obtained plus data from 110 children with IgA vasculitis (HSP) from  the Instituto Nacional de Pediatria were used to compare groups and identify  prognostic factors. We performed a case-control study in patients < 18 years,  consisting of 15 cases retrospectively identified with IgA vasculitis  (HSP) + jSLE, and 110 IgA vasculitis (HSP) control subjects. RESULTS: The  information of 12,819 IgA vasculitis (HSP) subjects from the systematic review  and 110 IgA vasculitis (HSP) controls was obtained and compared to our 15 IgA  vasculitis (HSP) + jSLE cases. The mean age of IgA vasculitis (HSP) was 7.1-years  vs. 10.4-years of IgA vasculitis (HSP) + jSLE at the HSP diagnosis. Female to  male ratio of IgA vasculitis (HSP) was 1:1.33 vs. 1:0.25 of IgA vasculitis  (HSP) + jSLE. Patients with IgA vasculitis (HSP) + jSLE had lower levels of  Hemoglobin (Hb) compared to patients with IgA vasculitis (HSP) 109 g/L vs.  141 g/L. For the development of jSLE, we found older age and lower levels of Hb  as prognostic factors with OR [95% CI]: 1.37 [1.06, 1.89] and 5.39 [2.69, 15.25],  respectively. CONCLUSION: IgA vasculitis (HSP) + jSLE patients are older and have  lower levels of Hb than patients with IgA vasculitis (HSP). It is necessary to  confirm these findings through a prospective study.

T1  - MAP4K Family Kinases and DUSP Family Phosphatases in T-Cell Signaling and 
AB  - T cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), which is a severe autoimmune disease. In the past 60 years, only one new  therapeutic agent with limited efficacy has been approved for SLE treatment;  therefore, the development of early diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets  for SLE is desirable. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases  (MAP4Ks) and dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are regulators of MAP kinases.  Several MAP4Ks and DUSPs are involved in T-cell signaling and autoimmune  responses. HPK1 (MAP4K1), DUSP22 (JKAP), and DUSP14 are negative regulators of  T-cell activation. Consistently, HPK1 and DUSP22 are downregulated in the T cells  of human SLE patients. In contrast, MAP4K3 (GLK) is a positive regulator of  T-cell signaling and T-cell-mediated immune responses. MAP4K3  overexpression-induced RORgammat-AhR complex specifically controls interleukin 17A  (IL-17A) production in T cells, leading to autoimmune responses. Consistently,  MAP4K3 and the RORgammat-AhR complex are overexpressed in the T cells of human SLE  patients, as are DUSP4 and DUSP23. In addition, DUSPs are also involved in either  human autoimmune diseases (DUSP2, DUSP7, DUSP10, and DUSP12) or T-cell activation  (DUSP1, DUSP5, and DUSP14). In this review, we summarize the MAP4Ks and DUSPs  that are potential biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for SLE.

T1  - Membranous Lupus Nephritis: A Clinical Review.
SP  - 393-403
AB  - Membranous lupus nephritis (MLN) (Class V lupus nephritis [LN]) is a distinct  form of LN defined by the presence of subepithelial immune complex deposits seen  on kidney biopsy. MLN is often associated with the nephrotic syndrome. The  histology of MLN closely resembles that of idiopathic (primary) membranous  nephropathy (pMN). However, MLN typically has abundant mesangial deposits that  are absent in primary membranous nephropathy. The clinical presentation,  management, and prognosis of MLN differ from that of the proliferative forms of  LN (Class III, IV, or Mixed III/IV + V). Although immunosuppressive therapy is  often warranted in MLN, the optimal treatment regimen remains unclear. Here we  describe the clinical presentation, histologic features, and natural history of  MLN. We also review the role of supportive treatment and discuss when to deploy  immunosuppressive management in MLN.

AB  - The kidney biopsy advanced our understanding of kidney disease in systemic lupus  erythematosus. It allowed for better recognition and classification of lupus  nephritis (LN). Several LN classifications have been devised in an effort to  inform treatment decision and predict prognosis, and these are being further  updated. In this review, we will examine the role of diagnostic as well as repeat  kidney biopsy in the management of LN, including the potential role of molecular  interrogation as a step forward beyond conventional histology to guide the  discovery of novel biomarkers and a precision medicine approach to the management  of LN.

T1  - Moving Forward With Biologics in Lupus Nephritis.
SP  - 338-350
AB  - The majority of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus develop lupus  nephritis (LN) which significantly contributes to increased risks of  hospitalizations, ESRD, and death. Unfortunately, treatments for LN have not  changed over the past 15 years. Despite continued efforts to elucidate the  pathogenesis of LN, no new drugs have yet replaced the standard-of-care regimens  of cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil plus high-dose corticosteroids. The  significant limitations of standard-of-care are low complete response rates, risk  of flares, and ongoing inflammation in the kidney leading to progressive renal  dysfunction. Repeat and prolonged treatments are often needed to control disease,  leading to a high level of severe side effects. The development of targeted drugs  with better efficacy and safety are desperately needed. The rationale for  targeting key immunologic pathways in LN continues to be strongly supported by  basic and translational research and has generated the hope and excitement of  testing these therapies in human LN. This review provides an overview of  biologics studied to date in clinical trials of LN, discusses the potential  reasons for their failure, and addresses the challenges moving forward.

T1  - Lupus Nephritis and Kidney Transplantation: Where Are We Today?
SP  - 313-322
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is the cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) for 1.9% of  the ESKD population in the United States. Although the incidence rates of ESKD  from LN stopped rising in recent years, racial disparities in waiting time,  pre-emptive kidney transplant, and transplant outcomes still exist. Patients with  LN who progress to ESKD tend to be female, of African ancestry, and young. Kidney  transplantation is safe in this population and associated with a substantial  survival benefit, primarily due to reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease and  infection. Transplant outcomes for patients with ESKD due to LN are similar to  those without LN.

T1  - Comparison of Different Uses of Cyclophosphamide in Lupus Nephritis: A 
SP  - 687-702
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to compare the relative efficacy and safety of  different uses of cyclophosphamide (CYC) in lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: We  searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE and PubMed for  articles from the database till June 2018. RESULTS: 12 randomized controlled  trials with 994 participants were included. The meta-analysis indicated that the  short-interval lower-dose intravenous CYC regime remarkably reduced 24-hour  proteinuria [mean difference (MD) -0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.62 to  -0.27; I2 0%], incidence of major infections [odds ratio (OR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.40  to 0.95; I2 42%], gonadal toxicity (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.62; I2 0%), and  leukopenia (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.94, I2 0%), while high-dose regime had an  obvious lower probability of doubling of serum creatinine (Scr) level (OR 2.43;  95% CI 1.19 to 4.95; I2 0%). However, the difference in the complete and total  remission rates between the two regimens was not observed. CONCLUSION: The result  suggested that the short-interval lower-dose CYC regime remarkably reduced  24-hour proteinuria and the incidence of adverse events, while the long-course  high-dose regime played a significant role in reducing the rate of doubling Scr  level.

T1  - Activation of stem cell up-regulation/mobilization: a cardiovascular risk in both 
SP  - 309-316
AB  - Experimentally induced injury triggers up-regulation and mobilization of stem  cells in Apoe -/- mice that causes accelerated atherosclerosis. Abca1 -/-  Abcg1-/- mice have chronic activation of stem cell up-regulation/mobilization and  accelerated atherosclerosis. In addition, the Abca1 -/- Abcg1-/- mice have  elevation of serum cytokines G-CSF, IL-17 and IL-23, each necessary for stem cell  mobilization. IL-17 and IL-23 are elevated in two human illnesses that have  cardiovascular (CV) risk independent of traditional risk factors-SLE and  psoriasis. Serum G-CSF, which can be elevated in liver disease, predicts major  adverse cardiovascular events in humans. These serum cytokine elevations suggest  activation of the stem cell mobilization mechanism in humans that results, as in  mice, in accelerated atherosclerosis. Efforts to reduce CV disease in these  patient populations should include mitigation of the diseases that trigger stem  cell mobilization. Since activation of the stem cell up-regulation/mobilization  mechanism appears to accelerate human atherosclerosis, use of stem cells as  therapy for arterial occlusive disease should distinguish between direct  administration of stem cells and activation of the stem cell  up-regulation/mobilization mechanism.

T1  - Pregnancy and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 24-30
AB  - As SLE onset is often in young adulthood, pregnancy is common and is usually  successful. Pregnancy, though, is considered high-risk due to a combination of  maternal (lupus flare, diabetes, pre-eclampsia) and fetal (miscarriage,  intrauterine fetal demise, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction,  congenital heart block) risks. Pregnancy should be planned for a time of good  control of SLE (on allowable medications). The antimalarial hydroxychloroquine  should be continued. The only permitted immunosuppressive drugs are azathioprine  and tacrolimus. Of the antiphospholipid antibodies, only the lupus anticoagulant  has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in the largest prospective  multicenter study, Predictors of Pregnancy Outcome: Biomarkers in  Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (PROMISSE).  Management of antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy is low molecular weight  heparin and aspirin, although only 75% of pregnancies are successful.

T1  - A clinical score to guide in decision making for monogenic type I IFNopathies.
SP  - 745-752
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a set of clinical criteria that identifies patients with a  potential autoinflammatory IFNopathy. METHODS: Based on a literature review, a  set of clinical criteria identifying genetically confirmed monogenic IFNopathies  was selected. For validation, the clinical score was assessed in healthy controls  (HCs) and 18 disease controls, including 2 known autoimmune IFNopathies, juvenile  systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE, n = 4) and dermatomyositis (JDM, n = 4);  adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency (DADA2, n = 4); and oligoarticular juvenile  idiopathic arthritis (oJIA, n = 6). We assessed an IFN score (IRG-S) in whole  blood by NanoString using a previously published 28-gene-IRG-S and a reduced  6-gene-IRG-S. RESULTS: The 12 patients with a possible IFNopathy had higher  clinical scores (3-5) than the patients with sJLE, JDM, DADA2, and oJIA and in  HCs. Both the 28-IRG-S and 6-IRG-S were significantly higher in the  autoinflammatory IFNopathy patients compared to HCs and oJIA and DADA2 patients  but not different from patients with JSLE and JDM. Subsequently, genetic analysis  revealed mutations in genes previously reported in genes related to the IFN  pathway in 9 of the 12 patients. CONCLUSION: We developed a clinical score to  identify patients with possible autoinflammatory IFNopathies. A clinical score  was associated with a high IRG-S and may serve to identify patients with an  autoinflammatory IFNopathy.

T1  - Hydroxychloroquine may be beneficial in preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriage.
SP  - 39-49
AB  - Recurrent miscarriage (RM) and vasculoplacental disorders, such as preeclampsia  (PE), affect women of childbearing age worldwide. Vascular endothelial  dysfunction and immunological impairment are associated with both RM and PE. To  date, there is no effective or optimal therapeutic approach for these conditions.  Notably, aspirin use is only partially effective in the prevention of PE.  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has demonstrated beneficial effects on disease flares,  pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular impairment in systemic erythaematosus lupus  (SLE) through its immunomodulatory, vasculoprotective and antithrombotic  properties. Here, in the context of the underlying physiological dysregulation  associated with PE and RM, the beneficial properties and potential therapeutic  efficacy of HCQ are reviewed in anticipation of the results of current and future  trials. Two related trials addressing RM in the absence of maternal autoimmune  disease are ongoing. Other trials addressing pregnancy outcomes in the presence  of maternal autoimmune disease are forthcoming. In this review, we hypothesise  that the immunological and endothelial effects of HCQ may be beneficial in the  context of PE and RM, regardless of the maternal autoimmune status.

T1  - Interferon-Inducible Protein 10 and Disease Activity in Systemic Lupus 
AB  - There is increasing evidence of a correlation between interferon-inducible  protein 10 (IP-10) and disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and  lupus nephritis (LN). We conducted a comprehensive search on IP-10 using MEDLINE,  Scopus, and Cochrane electronic databases from the beginning to the end of  December 2017. All studies that compared serum and/or urine IP-10 between active  SLE/LN patients and any control groups were identified and included in this  systematic review and meta-analysis. The mean difference (MD) of IP-10 level  among active SLE and LN patients, as well as the correlation of IP-10 with  disease activity, were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model. From 23  eligible studies, 15 provided adequate data for meta-analysis. Serum IP-10 was  significantly elevated in patients with active SLE compared to non-active SLE  patients (MD 356.5 pg/mL, 95% CI 59.6 to 653.4, p = 0.019). On the other hand,  the levels of serum IP-10 was not different between active LN and non-active LN.  However, serum IP-10 was positively correlated with disease activity like SLE  disease activity index (SLEDAI) (pooled r = 0.29, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.35, p <  0.001). Furthermore, urine IP-10 tended to be higher in patients with active LN  compared to non-active LN patients but this did not reach statistical  significance (MD 3.47 pg/mgCr x 100, 95% CI -0.18 to 7.12, p = 0.06).  Nevertheless, urine IP-10 was positively correlated with renal SLEDAI (pooled r =  0.29, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.50, p = 0.019). In conclusion, serum and urine IP-10  levels may be useful in monitoring the disease activity of SLE and LN. Serum  IP-10 was correlated with systemic disease whereas urine IP-10 was a useful  biomarker for detecting active LN.

T1  - Targeting MDM2 for novel molecular therapy: Beyond oncology.
SP  - 856-880
AB  - The murine double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene exerts major oncogenic activities in  human cancers; it is not only the best-documented negative regulator of the p53  tumor suppressor, but also exerts p53-independent activities. There is an  increasing interest in developing MDM2-based targeted therapies. Several classes  of MDM2 inhibitors have been evaluated in preclinical models, with a few entering  clinical trials, mainly for cancer therapy. However, noncarcinogenic roles for  MDM2 have also been identified, demonstrating that MDM2 is involved in many  chronic diseases and conditions such as inflammation and autoimmune diseases,  dementia and neurodegenerative diseases, heart failure and cardiovascular  diseases, nephropathy, diabetes, obesity, and sterility. MDM2 inhibitors have  been shown to have promising therapeutic efficacy for treating inflammation and  other nonmalignant diseases in preclinical evaluations. Therefore, targeting MDM2  may represent a promising approach for treating and preventing these nonmalignant  diseases. In addition, a better understanding of how MDM2 works in nonmalignant  diseases may provide new biomarkers for their diagnosis, prognostic prediction,  and monitoring of therapeutic outcome. In this review article, we pay special  attention to the recent findings related to the roles of MDM2 in the pathogenesis  of several nonmalignant diseases, the therapeutic potential of its downregulation  or inhibition, and its use as a biomarker.

T1  - Cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus for the treatment of moderate-to-severe lupus 
SP  - 1125-1141
AB  - Aim: Therapy for lupus nephritis (LN) requires treatment with immunosuppressive  regimens, often including intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY), mycophenolate  mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine. Additionally, tacrolimus (original form or  generic) is recommended to treat LN patients in Asia, including China. However,  the cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus therapy has not previously been assessed. We  aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tacrolimus in the treatment of  moderate-to-severe LN versus standard therapies in China. Materials & methods:  This cost-effectiveness model combined a decision-tree/Markov-model structure to  map transitions between health states during induction and maintenance treatment  phases. Induction with tacrolimus, IVCY or MMF, was followed by tacrolimus, MMF  or azathioprine maintenance. Results: According to the model, during induction,  complete remission rates were higher with tacrolimus versus IVCY (relative risk  1.40 vs IVCY [deterministic sensitivity analysis minimum 0.92, maximum 2.13]) and  time to response was shorter. Relapse rates were lower with tacrolimus versus  azathioprine or MMF during maintenance. Tacrolimus induction and maintenance was  the most cost-effective regimen, incurring the lowest total costs (CN yen180,448)  with the highest quality-adjusted life-years. Conclusion: The model demonstrated  that tacrolimus use in both induction and maintenance therapy may be an  efficacious and cost-effective treatment for LN in China.

T1  - The Course of Rheumatic Diseases During Pregnancy.
SP  - 464-470
AB  - Rheumatic diseases commonly affect women of childbearing age, when women may be  contemplating pregnancy or they discover an unplanned pregnancy. Therefore,  specific issues about pregnancy planning and management are commonly encountered  in patients during these times. Knowledge of the effect of pregnancy on disease  activity is important for counseling. This review summarizes recent data on the  course of different rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and the postpartum  period. Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus are the most  commonly investigated diseases. Data are increasing about spondyloarthritis.  Sparse data are available for other rheumatic diseases. Despite the differences  in these diseases and the various courses these disease take during pregnancy, a  common feature is that active maternal disease in the months prior to conception  increases the risk of flares during pregnancy, which in turn can lead to adverse  pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, maternal and fetal health can be optimized if  conception is planned when disease is inactive so that a treatment regimen can be  maintained throughout pregnancy.

T1  - Update on pregnancy complications in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 650-658
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes recent research in the field of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and pregnancy with focus on clinical and  biochemical predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), accumulating  evidence for the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in pregnancy,  and the importance of preconception counseling. RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing research  from PROMISSE investigators (Predictors of Pregnancy Outcome: Biomarkers in  Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) adds to the  understanding of risk factors for APOs in SLE pregnancies, including aberrant  complement activation, incomplete downregulation of lupus-associated  transcription factors, and lower socioeconomic status. Evidence supporting  numerous advantages for continuing HCQ in pregnancy, as well as support for  low-dose aspirin in preeclampsia prevention is reviewed. Practice gaps exist  among rheumatologists in ensuring effective contraception when women of  childbearing age are undergoing therapy with potentially fetotoxic medications.  The publication of organizational guidelines provides evidence-based  recommendations on lupus pregnancy management. SUMMARY: Outcomes of lupus  pregnancies continue to improve with understanding of risk factors that predict  APOs as well as improvements in disease management. Rheumatologists caring for  women with SLE should be familiar with the most up-to-date research in order to  optimize pregnancy outcomes in this population.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension.
SP  - 102371
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a high burden of  cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is in part imputed to classical vascular risk  factors such as hypertension. Hypertension is frequent among patients with SLE  and studies show it is more prevalent in SLE patients than in people without SLE.  Despite the high frequency of hypertension in SLE patients, the  pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension remain  poorly understood. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has emerged as a  valuable tool in determining blood pressure (BP) in SLE patients in whom  hypertension has been associated with damage accrual, stroke and cognitive  dysfunction. Although prevalent, current guidelines neglect the specific  management of hypertension in SLE patients in their recommendations. This review  discusses the mechanisms that may lead to hypertension and the literature  evaluating hypertension screening and management in SLE patients.

T1  - Autoantibodies in SLE: prediction and the p value matrix.
SP  - 1285-1293
AB  - Autoantibodies (AA) and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) serve as key diagnostic and  classification criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). More than 200  different AA have been reported in SLE, although only a handful (<20) are  considered "mainstream" because they are widely and routinely used in diagnostic,  research and clinical medicine. Although the vast majority of AA have been  relegated to the diminished status of "orphan" AA, some serve as predictors of  SLE because they first appear in very early or subclinical SLE. Some AA are  pathogenic, whereas others are thought to protect against or ameliorate disease  progression and, hence, taken together can be used as predictive biomarkers of  prognosis. Although studies have shown that specific AA are detected in the  preclinical phase of SLE and are biomarkers of increased risk of developing the  disease, AA are currently not widely used to predict very early SLE in  individuals who have low pretest probability of disease. With the advent of  multianalyte arrays with analytic algorithms, emerging evidence indicates that  when certain combinations of biomarkers, such as the interferon signature and  stem cell factor accompany AA and ANA, the predictive power for SLE is markedly  increased.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: challenges and progress.
SP  - 682-688
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The management of lupus nephritis remains unsatisfactory due  to insufficiently effective treatment regimens and the dearth of reliable  predictors of disease onset or progression to guide individualized therapeutic  decisions. This review summarizes new findings related to lupus nephritis over  the last 18 months and discusses clinical needs that should be considered to  advance trials of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies. RECENT FINDINGS:  Collaborative teams are addressing how to improve disease definitions and are  developing predictive models for disease onset, disease response and risk of  flare in individual patients. More attention is being paid to clinical trial  design. Advanced technologic approaches are allowing the analysis of small  amounts of human tissue and urine in unprecedented detail so as to discover new  pathogenic mechanisms and identify disease biomarkers. Novel therapies continue  to be tested in disease models and include new strategies to protect renal tissue  from cell damage and fibrosis. SUMMARY: The collaborative efforts of patients,  clinical and translational researchers, the pharmaceutical industry and funding  sources are needed to advance therapies for lupus nephritis. Specialized clinical  centers can then deliver optimal and more personalized patient care that will  improve patient outcomes.

SP  - 715-722
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune connective-tissue disorder  with a wide range of clinical manifestations that predominantly affect women.  Many aspects of its pathogenesis are still unclear, and new therapeutic  strategies are progressively emerging. Thus, in this review we aim to summarise  the most relevant data on SLE that emerged during 2018, following the previous  annual review of this series. In particular, the review will focus on new  insights in SLE regarding new pathogenetic pathways, new biomarkers, new data on  clinical manifestations, clinical outcomes and comorbidities and what has emerged  on new drugs and new therapeutic strategies.

T1  - Gas6/TAM Receptors in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 7838195
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multiorgan autoimmune disease associated  with impaired immune system regulation. The exact mechanisms of SLE development  remain to be elucidated. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important for  apoptotic cell clearance, immune homeostasis, and resolution of immune responses.  TAM deficiency leads to lupus-like autoimmune diseases. Activation of TAM  receptors leads to proteolytic cleavage of the receptors, generating soluble  forms of TAM. Circulating TAM receptors have an immunoregulatory function and may  also serve as biomarkers for disease prognosis. Here, we review the biological  function and signaling of TAM RTKs in the development and pathogenesis of lupus  and lupus nephritis. Targeting Gas6/TAM pathways may be of therapeutic benefit. A  discussion of potential TAM activation and inhibition in the treatment of lupus  and lupus nephritis is included.

T1  - SLE pachymeningitis and multiple cranial nerve palsies: a case report and review 
SP  - 1154-1157
AB  - Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a relatively uncommon disease associated  with focal or diffuse thickening of the dura mater secondary to underlying  chronic inflammation. The link between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and  hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is extremely rare, with only six other cases  reported in the literature. We, however, report the first case of SLE  pachymeningitis presenting with multiple cranial nerve palsies. The patient  showed good response to steroids and cyclophosphamide therapy. One should  maintain a high index of suspicion to make the diagnosis in patients with SLE  presenting with neurological dysfunction. Prompt therapy prevents long-term  neurological sequelae.

T1  - Efficacy and Safety of Vitamin D Supplementation in Patients With Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 104-114
AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains uncertain. This meta-analysis aimed to  systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitamin D supplementation in  patients with SLE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  were searched in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science databases.  The retrieved studies were subjected to meta-analysis using the fixed-effect or  random-effect model. RESULTS: Five eligible RCTs enrolling 490 participants were  included. Compared to the placebo treatment, vitamin D supplementation  significantly increased the level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) (5  trials, 490 participants: standard mean difference (SMD) = 2.072, 95% CI:  1.078-3.066, P < 0.001). The pooled result from 2 RCTs showed that vitamin D  supplementation decreased the fatigue severity scale scores in patients with SLE  (2 trials, 79 participants: SMD = -1.179, 95% CI: -1.897 to -0.460, P = 0.001).  The SLE disease activity index scores and positivity of anti-double-stranded DNA  antibodies (anti-dsDNA) did not differ significantly (4 trials, 223 participants:  SMD = -0.507, 95% CI: -1.055-0.041, P = 0.070; 3 trials, 361 participants: Risk  ratio = 0.880, 95% CI: 0.734-1.054, P = 0.165) between the vitamin D  supplementation group and the placebo treatment group. None of the included  studies reported severe adverse events associated with vitamin D supplementation.  CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggested that vitamin D supplementation is  effective in increasing the serum 25(OH)D levels, may improve fatigue, and is  well-tolerated in patients with SLE, however, it does not seem to have  significant effects in decreasing the positivity of anti-dsDNA and disease  activity.

SP  - 369-377
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease, and standard  therapy algorithms include the use of agents with generalized immunosuppressive  effects. The outcomes for SLE patients have been markedly improved by this  approach. However, the concept that involved organs might be targeted for  treatment in an individual patient has potential to provide further benefits,  offering enhanced efficacy and fewer off-target effects. This review considers  how two of the most commonly involved organ systems in SLE, skin and kidney,  might be targets for new therapeutic approaches based on knowledge of underlying  mechanisms of disease.

T1  - The Gut Microbiome in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Lessons Learned From Other 
SP  - 1051-1070
AB  - There is a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiome in human  health and disease. Aided by advances in sequencing technologies and analytical  methods, recent research has shown the healthy gut microbiome to possess  considerable diversity and functional capacity. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota  is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of not only diseases that  primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract but also other less obvious diseases,  including neurologic, rheumatologic, metabolic, hepatic, and other illnesses.  Chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) represent a group of  diseases that share many underlying etiological factors including genetics,  aberrant immunological responses, and environmental factors. Gut dysbiosis has  been reported to be common to IMIDs as a whole, and much effort is currently  being directed toward elucidating microbiome-mediated disease mechanisms and  their implications for causality. In this review, we discuss gut microbiome  studies in several IMIDs and show how these studies can inform our understanding  of the role of the gut microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease.

T1  - Spontaneous coronary artery dissection in systemic lupus erythematosus: 
SP  - 1821-1827
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) present an increased prevalence  of coronary heart disease. The majority of cases of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)  in patients with SLE are due to atherosclerosis. Less common causes include  thrombosis of an angiographically normal coronary artery and coronary vasculitis.  Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of ACS in these  patients. We report the case of a 53-year-old female diagnosed of SLE presenting  with an ACS caused by SCAD. She was treated medically and her clinical course was  favorable. A literature search identified seven additional cases of SCAD  associated with SLE. The main clinical features found in these reports are  revised. ACS caused by SCAD in SLE patients is a condition likely under-reported  in literature. SCAD should be suspected in patients with SLE and ACS, especially  in younger women without evident cardiovascular risk factors. An early accurate  diagnosis of SCAD is key to provide specific treatment, which differs from that  of usual atherosclerotic ACS.

T1  - Lipidomics in autoimmune diseases with main focus on systemic lupus 
SP  - 386-395
AB  - Autoimmune diseases (AID) are a heterogeneous group of disorders that have in  common a chronic inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system. Systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the most frequent systemic autoimmune  diseases characterized by autoimmune phenomena in multiple organs. The tests used  for evolution and prognosis assessment are either non-specific or non-sensitive,  impairing an adequate therapeutics. To face this drawback, lipidomics is being  used to provide more knowledge and insights regarding autoimmune disorders.  Through lipidomic approaches using MS, it is possible to identify and quantify  the level of lipid molecular species in the biological system and this could be  useful to identify biomarkers and to better understand the pathophysiology of  autoimmune diseases. There are some evidence that lipids and oxidized lipids can  play a key role in AID pathogenesis. Although this field has been scarcely  explored, there are some studies that reported variations on the lipid profile at  a molecular level using lipidomic approaches based on MS in SLE. The results  gathered herein showed changes mainly in the level of phospholipids, with  decrease of some plasmenyl lipids, fatty acids, with reduction of PUFA, and  sphingolipids, with changes in fatty acyl chain composition. These changes may be  the result of lipids; modifications due to oxidation and increase of ROS. Some  alterations can be associated with changes in membrane of lymphocytes and with  the deregulation of the immune system. Thus, exploring the knowledge from modern  lipidomic approaches in the study of the role of lipids and oxidized lipids, in  oxidative stress and in inflammatory diseases, could contribute for the  identification of new lipid biomarkers. Lipid biomarkers are promising tools to  prognosis and treatment monitoring, tailored for the best therapeutic response  and highest safety to ensure better patient care and to be used for personalized  medicine.

T1  - Management strategies and future directions for systemic lupus erythematosus in 
SP  - 2332-2343
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterised by the  loss of self-tolerance and formation of nuclear autoantigens and immune complexes  resulting in inflammation of multiple organs. The clinical presentation of SLE is  heterogeneous, can involve one or more organs, including the skin, kidneys,  joints, and nervous system, and take a chronic or relapsing and remitting disease  course. SLE is most common in women and in those of non-white ethnicity. Because  of the multitude of presentations, manifestations, and serological abnormalities  in patients with SLE, diagnosis can be challenging. Therapeutic approaches  predominantly involve immunomodulation and immunosuppression and are targeted to  the specific organ manifestation, with the aim of achieving low disease activity.  Despite many treatment advances and improved diagnostics, SLE continues to cause  substantial morbidity and premature mortality. Current management strategies,  although helpful, are limited by high failure rates and toxicity. An overreliance  on corticosteroid therapy contributes to much of the long-term organ damage. In  this Seminar, we outline the classification criteria for SLE, current treatment  strategies and medications, the evidence supporting their use, and explore  potential future therapies.

T1  - Autoimmunity in obstetrics and autoimmune diseases in pregnancy.
SP  - 66-76
AB  - Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are associated with strong female preponderance and  often present before or during the reproductive years; consequently, pregnancy  and breastfeeding are topics of major interest for these patients. AIDs show  different responses to pregnancy: some ameliorate, while others remain unchanged,  and several AIDs aggravate. The response of the AIDs to the hormonal and  immunological alterations of pregnancy reflects the different pathophysiology of  each disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome  (APS) are associated with multiple autoantibodies, multiorgan involvement, more  aggressive therapy, and increased impact on pregnancy outcome. For the management  of pregnancy in patients with SLE and/or APS, it is important to individuate the  correct risk profile for each woman and timing for treatment. The optimal timing  for starting or modulating treatment is at preconception assessment to influence  the placentation. In this chapter, we discuss the management of pregnancy in  patients with AIDs.

T1  - Autoimmune Hepatitis A Case Report and Literature Review.
SP  - 146-152
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a cause of chronic liver disease. It  is usually suspected based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings, but  the diagnosis relies on the presence of specific autoantibodies and  characteristic histology. Other unexplained findings should always prompt  investigation for coexisting syndromes. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a  60-year-old Hispanic female with a history of mild asthma presented with  exertional and pleuritic chest pain with weight loss, arthralgia, subjective  fever, and night sweats for the last 3 months. Given the nonspecific nature of  the presentation, further workup was pursued. Laboratory results indicated  pancytopenia, elevated INR, and positive autoimmune panel including ANA,  anti-chromatin, anti-histone, and rheumatoid factor as well as abnormal C3 and  C4. Subsequent liver biopsy with interface hepatitis lead to a diagnosis of AIH  with concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus suspected. CONCLUSION: The  diagnostic work up for AIH is multimodal and aims to differentiate other  etiologies such as congestive hepatopathy, iron overload, viral hepatitis, and  other autoimmune liver diseases. In this particular case, unusual clinical and  laboratory findings led to diagnosis of the overlap syndrome. Treatment for both  was necessary to prevent further progression of disease.

T1  - Curcumin in Autoimmune and Rheumatic Diseases.
AB  - Over recent decades, many clinical trials on curcumin supplementation have been  conducted on various autoimmune diseases including osteoarthritis, type 2  diabetes, and ulcerative colitis patients. This review attempts to summarize the  highlights from these clinical trials. The efficacy of curcumin either alone or  in conjunction with existing treatment was evaluated. Sixteen clinical trials  have been conducted in osteoarthritis, 14 of which yielded significant  improvements in multiple disease parameters. Eight trials have been conducted in  type 2 diabetes, all yielding significant improvement in clinical or laboratory  outcomes. Three trials were in ulcerative colitis, two of which yielded  significant improvement in at least one clinical outcome. Additionally, two  clinical trials on rheumatoid arthritis, one clinical trial on lupus nephritis,  and two clinical trials on multiple sclerosis resulted in inconclusive results.  Longer duration, larger cohort size, and multiple dosage arm trials are warranted  to establish the long term benefits of curcumin supplementation. Multiple  mechanisms of action of curcumin on these diseases have been researched,  including the modulation of the eicosanoid pathway towards a more  anti-inflammatory pathway, and the modulation of serum lipid levels towards a  favorable profile. Overall, curcumin supplementation emerges as an effective  therapeutic agent with minimal-to-no side effects, which can be added in  conjunction to current standard of care.

T1  - Critical limb ischemia in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus: a case 
SP  - 114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular disease is the rarest vascular complication in  systemic lupus erythematosus. Some theories propose that immune complexes may  promote inflammation in the vessel, and disrupt it in a manner that may cause  ischemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old Asian girl presented with intermittent  claudication as the chief complaint followed by discoloration of her left big toe  for 2 weeks prior to admission. Her medical history showed that 1 month prior to  admission she had photosensitivity, rash, and arthralgia, with positive  antinuclear antibody test, positive anti-double-stranded DNA test, positive  anti-ribosomal protein P, and complement C4 (7.4 mg/dL); she was diagnosed as  having systemic lupus erythematosus and started therapy. A local examination of  her left toe showed black discoloration, low pulsation, localized tenderness, and  decreased sensation. Laboratory results showed C-reactive protein of 1.16 mg/dL  and D-dimer of 2.28 uG/mL. A computed tomography angiogram showed near total  occlusion of her popliteal artery; critical limb ischemia was confirmed.  Peripheral arteriography was performed with invasive strategy. After the  procedure, the flow was improved to distal, but there was inflammation in the  vessel, so we decided to stop the procedure because of the risk of dissection.  Our patient was given atorvastatin and warfarin, and we maximized her systemic  lupus erythematosus therapy with prednisone. There were two follow-ups. The first  follow-up was 1 week after the procedure. Our patient attended her first  follow-up at our out-patient department with no symptoms and improvement in her  toe's discoloration; warfarin was stopped, and clopidogrel and cilostazol were  added for thrombus prevention therapy, she was then scheduled for debridement.  The second follow-up was done 2 months after the first follow-up and  discoloration was improved. The third follow-up, 5 months after the second  follow-up, showed improvement. CONCLUSION: Critical limb ischemia is a rare  complication of systemic lupus erythematosus that requires immediate treatment.  Due to our limited resources, we improvised a strategy to achieve the best  possible outcome in our patient by using a combination of invasive treatment and  medication.

T1  - Thrombocytopenia as a Prognostic Marker for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A 
SP  - 461-467
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients often exhibit  hematological abnormalities, but the role of thrombocytopenia on the prognosis of  SLE shows inconsistent results. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to confirm  the impact of thrombocytopenia on mortality and end organ damage in patients with  SLE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three electronic databases, PubMed, Embase and  Cochrane library were systematically searched to identify the eligible studies  from inception to November 2017 in order to evaluate the impact of  thrombocytopenia on the prognosis of patients with SLE. The summary odds ratios  (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure the impact of  thrombocytopenia on mortality and end organ damage based on the random-effects  model. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies that reported data on 2,158 patients with  SLE were included. The summary OR indicated that SLE subjects with  thrombocytopenia were significantly associated with an increased risk of  mortality (OR: 4.57; 95% CI: 2.28-9.17; P < 0.001) and end-organ damage (OR:  3.31; 95% CI: 1.11-9.86; P = 0.031). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis  indicated stable mortality, while the result for end organ damage was variable.  In addition, the patients with thrombocytopenia with disease duration <60 months  presented a greater risk for mortality than those with disease duration >/=60.0  months (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLE and thrombocytopenia were  found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality and end organ damage.

T1  - Non-pharmacologic therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 703-712
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacologic therapies have been deemed as potentially  beneficial for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We conducted an  updated review to determine the effects of these therapies to inform practice.  METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE,  Cochrane, PsychINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health  Literature, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from inception until August 2018.  We included randomized controlled trials of non-pharmacologic therapies in  systemic lupus erythematosus patients with sample size >/=10. Systemic lupus  erythematosus was defined by 1982 or 1997 American College of Rheumatology  criteria. Studies were synthesized separately by patient-reported outcomes and  disease activity. Due to the heterogeneity of interventions and comparisons, a  meta-analysis was not performed. RESULTS: A total of 15 randomized controlled  trials involving 846 participants met the inclusion criteria. Of the 15 trials,  eight used exercise interventions, six used psychological interventions (one  group psychotherapy, three cognitive behavioral therapies, one psychoeducation,  one mindfulness-based cognitive therapy) and one used electro-acupuncture. Five  of 15 studies utilized control groups consisting of usual medical care. Other  studies included control interventions of relaxation, attention placebo, symptom  monitoring support, education, minimal needling, isotonic and resistance  exercise. Compared with the control conditions, non-pharmacological interventions  were associated with a significant improvement in fatigue in three out of six  studies. Three out of eight studies reported improved anxiety and depression, and  one study reported improved pain after interventions. Seven out of 11 studies  reported improvement in overall quality of life in at least one domain of the  Short-Form Health Survey. Of note, no studies demonstrated an improvement in  disease activity after 5-52 weeks of non-pharmacological therapies. CONCLUSION:  This review showed promising results for physical exercise and psychological  interventions as adjuncts to traditional medical therapy for improvement in  fatigue, depression, pain and quality of life for systemic lupus erythematosus.  Further high-quality randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up periods  are warranted.

T1  - Impact of antimalarial (AM) on serum lipids in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 
SP  - e15030
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a common disorder in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) patients. It is still inconclusive whether antimalarial drugs could affect  the serum lipids in SLE patients, therefore we conducted a systematic review and  meta-analysis of available data to address this issue. METHODS: We  comprehensively searched the databases of PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library  from date of inception to Sep 2018 for both randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  and observational studies. Review Manager 5.3 software was used for analysis. We  performed meta-analysis using random-effects model and weighted the mean  difference (WMD) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The Q test was used to  assess the presence of heterogeneity and the I index was used to quantify the  extent of heterogeneity. RESULTS: In total, 8 studies met our selection criteria  including 2 RCTs, 2 cohort studies, and 4 case-control studies. There were 717  patients (336 patients in CQ (chloroquine) or HCQ (hydroxychloroquine) group, and  381 patients in control group (SLE patients without the therapy of AM)). Compared  with the control group, TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C were associated with a significant  decrease, respectively (WMD = -21.40 mg/dL, 95% CI -27.62 to -15.18, P < .00001),  (WMD = -29.07 mg/dL, 95% CI -45.28 to -12.86, P = .0004), (WMD = -16.25 mg/dL,  95% CI -28.82 to -3.68, P = .01), (WMD = -6.41 mg/dL, 95% CI -12.39 to 0.44,  P = .04), however the change of HDL-C did not reach statistically significance  (WMD = 4.42 mg/dL, 95% CI -1.21 to 10.06, P = .12). CONCLUSIONS: CQ or HCQ can  infect the serum lipids in SLE patients. However, these results should be  interpreted with cautions since lacking sufficient RCTs.

T1  - Incomplete Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: What Remains After Application of 
SP  - 607-614
AB  - Incomplete systemic lupus (iSLE) is an acknowledged condition of patients with  clinical signs of lupus who do not fulfill classification criteria for SLE. Some  patients with iSLE have persistent mild disease, but others have serious organ  involvement, and up to 55% progress to established SLE. Research on this subject  could reveal predictive or diagnostic biomarkers for SLE. Ideally, it would  become possible to discern those patients with critical organ involvement or a  high risk for progression to SLE. This high-risk group might benefit from early  treatment, which would preferably be confirmed in randomized controlled trials.  This process would, however, require agreement on a definition of iSLE. The  Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) classification  criteria was composed in order to diagnose SLE earlier. The present review  outlines the clinical characteristics of iSLE after introduction of SLICC  criteria and furthermore proposes a definition of iSLE with the aim of  discriminating the high-risk group from those with a lower risk.

T1  - Renal disease in pregnancy: Fetal, neonatal and long-term outcomes.
SP  - 60-76
AB  - Renal disease in women of childbearing age is estimated to be approximately 3%;  consequently, renal disease is not an uncommon comorbidity in pregnancy. There  has been considerable evidence published over the last 20 years to suggest that  renal disease in pregnancy is associated with higher maternal, fetal, and  offspring morbidity. Studies published are largely heterogeneous; include  unmatched cohort studies; and focus on early neonatal outcomes such as  prematurity, small for gestational age, and neonatal unit admission. There  appears to be an inverse relationship between maternal renal function and  likelihood of neonatal morbidity using these outcome measures. Overall though,  data regarding medium-to long-term outcomes for children born to mothers with  renal disease are scarce. However, in view of emerging epidemiological evidence  regarding cardiovascular programming in intrauterine life in those born premature  or small for gestational age, it is likely that this population of children  remain at high risk of cardiovascular disease as adults. The scope of this review  is to amalgamate and summarize existing evidence regarding the outcomes of  infants born to mothers with renal disease. Focus will be given to  pregnancy-related acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, dialysis, and  transplantation.

T1  - Refractory lupus nephritis: When, why and how to treat.
SP  - 510-518
AB  - Refractory lupus nephritis indicates an inadequate response to lupus nephritis  therapy. It implies persisting or worsening disease activity despite therapy, but  the definition is complicated by the parameters of response, proteinuria and  renal function, that do not discriminate clearly between activity and  irreversible damage. Understanding the causes of refractory disease and  developing treatment strategies is important because these patients are more  likely to develop poor outcomes, especially end stage renal disease. This review  explores current concepts and definitions of refractory disease and summarises  treatment approaches that have been used in observational cohort studies and case  series. We highlight the importance of optimising adherence to the prescribed  immunosuppressive and supportive measures and avoidance of diagnostic delay.  Treatment options include higher dose glucocorticoid, switching between  cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate acid derivates, or addition of rituximab, the  latter potentially in combination with belimumab. Less evidence supports  extracorporeal treatment (plasma exchange or immunoadsorption), calcineurin  inhibitors (cyclosporine A or tacrolimus), intravenous immunoglobulin and stem  cell transplantation. Improvements in understanding what refractory disease is  and how definitions can be integrated into treatment pathways has the potential  to enhance lupus nephritis outcomes.

T1  - Implants in patients with oral manifestations of autoimmune or muco-cutaneous 
SP  - e217-e230
AB  - BACKGROUND: To give an overview on implant survival rates in patients with oral  manifestations of systemic autoimmune (oral Lichen planus (oLp), Pemphigus (Pe)),  muco-cutaneous (Epidermolysis bullosa (EB)), autoimmune multisystemic rheumatic  diseases (Sjogren's syndrome (SjS), systemic Lupus erythematosus (sLE), or  systemic Sclerosis (sSc)). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic literature review  (PubMed/Medline, Embase) using MESH and search term combinations, published  between 1980 and August 2018 in English language reporting on dental  implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with oLp, Pe, EB, SjS, sLE, sSc,  study design, age, gender, follow-up period (>/= 12 months), implant survival rate.  Implant-related weighed mean values of implant survival rate (wmSR) were  calculated. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up period (mfp) of 44.6 months, a wmSR  of 98.3 % was calculated from data published for patients with oLp (100 patients  with 302 implants). Data of 27 patients (152 implants) with EB revealed wmSR of  98.7 % following mfp of 32.6 months. For 71 patients (272 implants) with SjS,  wmSR was 94.2 % following a mfp of 45.2 months, and for 6 patients (44 implants)  with sSc, wmSR was 97.7 % after mfp of 37.5 months. One case report on one  patient each with Pe (two implants) as well as sLE (6 implants) showed 100 % SR  following at least 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines regarding implant treatment  of patients with oLp, Pe, EB, SjS, sLE or sSc do not exist nor are  contraindicating conditions defined. Implant survival rates of patients affected  are comparable to those of healthy patients. For implant-prosthetic  rehabilitation of patients with Pe and sLE no conclusions can be drawn due to  lack of sufficient clinical data. Implant-prosthetic treatment guidelines  regarding healthy patients should be strictly followed, but frequent recall is  recommended in patients affected with oLp, SjS, EB, SSc, Pe or sLE.

T1  - Renal Outcomes of Pregnant Patients with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy: A 
SP  - 214-224
AB  - BACKGROUND: Is the prognosis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) influenced by  pregnancy and delivery? The answer to this question still remains to be a  controversial topic. Here, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to  obtain the overall estimate of potential effect of IgAN and pregnancy on each  other. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Chinese Biological  Medicine and Cochrane for cohort and case-control studies; a total of 1,378  articles were reviewed and 9 studies were included in the end. OR and mean  difference (MD) were calculated with a random-effects model, kidney events and  pregnancy outcomes were analyzed respectively. RESULTS: The key finding of the  meta-analysis of 145 renal events in 1,198 participants was that there was no  difference in renal outcomes (defined as doubling of serum creatinine (SCr), 50%  decline in glomerular filtration rate [GFR] and end-stage kidney disease) of  pregnant women compared with non-pregnant women who had IgAN (OR 0.90; 95% CI  0.59-1.37; p = 0.63). Subgroup analysis indicated that there was no significant  difference between the 2 groups according to sample size, follow-up year, age,  level of SCr and proteinuria at baseline. There was no difference in the change  of the eGFR/creatinine clearance rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 per year) in IgAN patients  with pregnancy compared with non-pregnancy (MD -0.11 mL/min; 95% CI -0.50-0.27; p  = 0.57) as well. Women with IgAN had a higher likelihood of pregnancy outcomes  compared with the Chinese general population, while they had a lower risk of  preterm delivery, preeclampsia and low birth weight compared with those who had  lupus nephritis or diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy did not  accelerate kidney disease deterioration in women with IgAN in stages of chronic  kidney disease 1-3. Moreover, patients with IgAN had a relatively low risk of  adverse pregnancy events compared with those with lupus nephritis or diabetic  nephropathy.

T1  - Thymoglobulin-Resistant T-Cell-Mediated Acute Rejection in a Pregnant Renal 
SP  - 159-163
AB  - To avoid graft rejection during pregnancy, frequent monitoring of serum drug  levels is recommended. Pregnancy induces hyperfiltration in transplanted kidneys,  as in native kidneys; therefore, detection of rejection can be difficult when  monitoring by serum creatinine. If rejection is suspected, ultrasonographguided  graft biopsy can be done; once proven, it can be treated with pulse steroids, but  data are scarce regarding other agents. Here, we present a 28-year-old pregnant  female patient with resistant acute rejection but with successful pregnancy  outcome. Our patient had end-stage kidney disease secondary to lupus nephropathy  and underwent living-donor renal transplant in May 2013 after hemodialysis  support for 1 year. She received thymoglobulin as induction therapy and was  maintained on prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. She had normal  renal graft function without proteinuria. After she received counseling, she  became pregnant in February 2015. In June 2015, she presented with acute graft  dysfunction with serum creatinine level of 365 mumol/L. Her abdominal  ultrasonography showed mild hydronephrosis and viable fetus. She received  empirical pulse steroids with partial response, and her graft biopsy showed acute  T-cell-mediated rejection and negative C4d. Intravenous immunoglobulins and  minipulse steroids were administered but without response. After gynecologic  counseling and informed consent, she received 5 doses of thymoglobulin. She was  dialysis dependent until premature vaginal labor, which resulted in birth of a  viable 2-kg boy. We suggest that successful pregnancy outcomes could occur with  close monitoring and daily dialysis in female kidney transplant patients with  resistant rejection.

T1  - Current challenges in the development of new treatments for lupus.
SP  - 729-735
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a  considerable impact on patients' quality of life. Despite the plethora of  clinical trials for SLE since the turn of the millennium, only one new treatment  has been approved for the condition, and the overall pace of successful drug  development remains slow. Nevertheless, the myriad of clinical studies has  yielded insights that have informed and refined our understanding of eligibility  criteria, outcome measures and trial design in SLE. In this review, we highlight  the achievements of clinical trials as well as the major pitfalls that have been  identified in drug development for SLE and, in doing so, identify areas where  collaboration and consensus will be important to facilitate progress.

T1  - Organ damage in patients treated with belimumab versus standard of care: a 
SP  - 372-379
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study (206347) compared organ damage progression in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who received belimumab in the BLISS long-term  extension (LTE) study with propensity score (PS)-matched patients treated with  standard of care (SoC) from the Toronto Lupus Cohort (TLC). METHODS: A systematic  literature review identified 17 known predictors of organ damage to calculate a  PS for each patient. Patients from the BLISS LTE and the TLC were PS matched  posthoc 1:1 based on their PS (+/-calliper). The primary endpoint was difference in  change in Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of  Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI) score from baseline to 5 years. RESULTS: For the  5- year analysis, of 567 (BLISS LTE n=195; TLC n=372) patients, 99 from each  cohort were 1:1 PS matched. Change in SDI score at Year 5 was significantly lower  for patients treated with belimumab compared with SoC (-0.434; 95% CI -0.667 to  -0.201; p<0.001). For the time to organ damage progression analysis (>/=1 year  follow-up), the sample included 965 (BLISS LTE n=259; TLC n=706) patients, of  whom 179 from each cohort were PS-matched. Patients receiving belimumab were 61%  less likely to progress to a higher SDI score over any given year compared with  patients treated with SoC (HR 0.391; 95% CI 0.253 to 0.605; p<0.001). Among the  SDI score increases, the proportion of increases >/=2 was greater in the SoC group  compared with the belimumab group. CONCLUSIONS: PS-matched patients receiving  belimumab had significantly less organ damage progression compared with patients  receiving SoC.

T1  - Secondary thrombotic microangiopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus and 
SP  - 74-83
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a life-threatening, albeit  infrequent, complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and  anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). Recommendations for the treatment of SLE- and  APS-related secondary TMA are currently based solely on case reports and expert  opinion. Unfortunately, interventions may not yield timely results or effectively  halt the progression of TMA. Since complement activation plays a key role in the  pathogenesis of secondary TMA due to SLE, APS, a therapy that targets the  complement pathway is an attractive intervention. Eculizumab, a recombinant,  fully humanized IgG2/IgG4 monoclonal antibody inhibits C5 activation and is  FDA-approved for PNH and atypical HUS (aHUS). However, limited case reports are  available on its use in treatment of secondary TMA. CASE PRESENTATION AND  RESULTS: We present the largest case series to date that includes 9 patients with  SLE and/or APS who were successfully treated with eculizumab for refractory  secondary TMA. In this case series, we report significant responses in hematology  values, renal function and other organs following treatment with eculizumab. At 4  weeks, 75% improvement in platelet counts was observed in 78% of patients.  Two-thirds of patients demonstrated >75% improvement of haptoglobin and LDH at  four weeks. At 4 weeks, eGFR improved by 25% in half of the patients, and 43% had  reductions in proteinuria. Two of 3 patients that required hemodialysis were able  to be taken off hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Based on these observations, we suggest  that eculizumab may be a potential treatment option for acutely ill patients with  secondary TMA due to SLE and/or APS who have failed standard of care. A  collective approach is needed to better elucidate the role and optimal timing of  eculizumab use in the management of TMA complicating SLE and/or APS.

T1  - Low-dose interleukin-2 therapy for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 208-212
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an overview behind the concept and recent advances  of low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  RECENT FINDINGS: A disruption of regulatory T cell homeostasis caused by an  acquired deficiency of IL-2 is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of SLE. Here,  we highlight the key rationales for the clinical translation of low-dose IL-2  therapy in SLE and summarize the main findings from two independent, early phase  uncontrolled clinical studies that investigated the immunological and clinical  responses to low-dose IL-2 therapy in patients with active SLE. Important  commonalities and differences between these studies with regard to study design  and results are discussed. SUMMARY: Low-dose IL-2 therapy is capable to promote  the selective expansion of a functionally competent regulatory T cell population  in a well-tolerated way and may have the potential to influence the clinical  course in patients with active SLE. Although a clearer proof for the clinical  efficacy of low-dose IL-2 therapy in SLE is still outstanding, these early  studies provide important rationales and the scientific basis for more  comprehensive and placebo-controlled trials in the future.

SP  - 213-218
AB  - Exosomes are membrane vesicles of endocytic origin that can mediate communication  between cells and the transport of cellular components such as microRNAs, mRNAs,  proteins and DNA. Recently, exosomes have been under investigation for their  significant roles in both healthy physiology and disease states. Herein, we  review the role of exosomes in chronic inflammatory skin diseases and skin  tumors, especially focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, atopic  dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid and melanoma. Moreover, we emphasize the  involvement of changes in exosome cargo in the regulation of these diseases.

T1  - Update on the epidemiology, risk factors, and disease outcomes of systemic lupus 
SP  - 188-205
AB  - Obtaining an updated view of the epidemiology, risk factors, and prognosis of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is pivotal to our understanding of the disease  burden. Recent community-based studies with comprehensive methodology provided  more accurate disease occurrence estimates and suggested that SLE may be more  frequent than previously thought. Gender, race, and socioeconomic status are  important disease determinants, and there is increasing appreciation of the  contribution of family history and environmental exposures in SLE susceptibility.  Owing to its systemic nature, assessment of disease activity is challenging, also  pertaining to efforts to improve trial endpoints for better discrimination  between active drug and placebo. Notably, emerging evidence supports that  remission or low disease activity states and prevention of flares are realistic  targets in the management of SLE associated with improved prognosis. For the  future, we anticipate that high-throughput analyses in patient cohorts will  enhance the identification of robust biomarkers for diagnosis, risk  stratification, and personalized treatment.

AB  - Central nervous system infections, which are rarely seen in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), have considerably high mortality but they are difficult to  distinguish from neuropsychiatric manifestation of lupus. This article reports  the case of a patient with SLE with brain abscess which developed during  immunosuppressive therapy for lupus nephritis. The patient completely recovered  without neurological sequelae by open surgical drainage and 12-week antibiotic  therapy. It is recommended that CNS infections must be excluded in patients with  SLE, particularly who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy.

T1  - Mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus: causes, predictors and interventions.
SP  - 1043-1053
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized  by organ damage, flare-remission pattern, and increased mortality when compared  with the general population. SLE mortality depends on epidemiological,  sociodemographic, genetic, and clinical factors. Mortality causes have been  mainly grouped in disease activity, infections, and cardiovascular complications.  Lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric lupus are the main manifestations associated  to mortality. Bacterial infection remains an important cause of death, and  cardiovascular mortality is almost double when compared to age - and sex-matched  comparisons. Characteristics such as time from onset to diagnosis > 1-year, renal  involvement, high SLEDAI and severe organ involvement, may be predictors of  mortality. Interventions including steroids, immunosuppressants, plasmapheresis,  some biologics, and vaccination have shown efficacy in reducing mortality rates.  Areas covered: In this narrative review the epidemiology, main causes of  mortality, potential predictors, and interventions are described. Expert  commentary: Despite early diagnosis and immunosuppressive treatment, SLE  mortality remains high. African-American, Hispanic-American origin, low  socioeconomic status and male sex are associated with increased mortality.  Currently, there is no unique, precise prediction model for mortality; however,  predictors for increased activity such as infections and cardiovascular events,  lead to increased mortality. New prediction models may indicate early  interventions in order to improve mortality rates.

T1  - The effectiveness and safety of biological therapeutics in juvenile-onset 
SP  - 2135-2145
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and summarize the available literature  regarding the effectiveness and safety of biologics in the treatment of  juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus. METHODS: PubMed was systematically  searched for relevant literature (2012-2017 inclusive) using the following  criteria: (1) patients diagnosed with juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus  (</=18 years at diagnosis); (2) treatment with any biological agent; and (3)  outcome measures assessing effectiveness and safety. Systematic literature  reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case  control studies, cross sectional surveys and case-series with >/=3 patients were  included. Independent extraction of articles by two authors using predefined  criteria was performed. The quality of each study was assessed using CASP tools  and Oxford CEBM Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Nine articles met inclusion  criteria: six cohort studies, two case series and one pilot study, totalling 230  patients. All but one article reported the effects of rituximab, the other those  of belimumab. Overall, patients had active disease refractory to standard of care  regimens using corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Available evidence for  rituximab demonstrated improvements in disease activity, complement levels and  anti-dsDNA titres accompanying a steroid-sparing effect. CONCLUSION: Rituximab  can be considered an effective treatment in juvenile-onset systemic lupus  erythematosus patients with severe disease manifestations and/or refractory  disease. Based on current evidence, use of belimumab in juvenile-onset systemic  lupus erythematosus patients cannot be recommended. The long-term safety of these  biological agents remains uncertain. Further prospective studies, ideally robust  randomized controlled trials, are urgently needed to obtain more accurate data on  the effectiveness and long-term safety of rituximab, belimumab and other  biologics in juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.

SP  - 2329-2335
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic  antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) overlap syndrome is an inflammatory disorder  with a mixed presentation that is characterized by clinical features of both SLE  and AAV. Although renal disease predominates, any organ system in the body may be  affected. Neurologic manifestation in patients with SLE-AAV overlap syndrome is  rare and has only been previously documented as cerebral ischemia. We report a  patient with SLE-AAV overlap syndrome diagnosed based on clinical, serologic and  biopsy-proven histologic findings who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage  (SAH) secondary to ruptured right anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. To the  authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of SLE-AAV overlap syndrome  diagnosed in a patient with a SAH due to an intracranial aneurysm. Neurologic  involvement in patients with SLE-AAV overlap syndrome is uncommon and has not  been well-studied. Clinicians who encounter patients with neurologic signs that  present with symptoms and a serologic profile that correspond to both SLE and AAV  criteria, should consider the association between SLE-AAV overlap syndrome and a  hemorrhagic stroke, specifically SAH.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: An update on treatments and pathogenesis.
SP  - 80-83
AB  - Immunosuppressive therapies for lupus nephritis (LN) have improved significantly  over the past few decades, resulting in growing number of choices for treatment  individualization and improved renal and patient outcomes. Corticosteroids  combined with mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide induces a satisfactory response  in a high proportion of Asian and Caucasian patients, but the rate of improvement  varies considerably between patients. Relatively low disease flare rate was  observed in Chinese patients receiving low-dose prednisolone and mycophenolate  maintenance. Short-term results with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are  encouraging, attributed both to their immunosuppressive efficacy and the action  of these agents on podocyte biology leading to more rapid proteinuria  suppression. Additional data, especially on the avoidance of nephrotoxicity and  metabolic side effects, is required to facilitate selection of patients  appropriate for this treatment. Modifications of standard regimens such as  reducing corticosteroid exposure or using enteric-coated mycophenolate might help  reduce treatment-related toxicities without compromising efficacy. While clinical  outcomes of patients have improved with recent therapeutic advances, individual  and ethnic variations in disease manifestations and treatment response, as well  as the prevention of infections and long-term complications still present  challenges to frontline clinicians. Recent data from histological examination and  translational studies also suggest that complement activation via the alternative  pathway, immune deposition on renal tubular basement membrane, and local  inflammatory responses involving resident kidney cells are of pathogenic  relevance in LN. The progress of clinical and translational studies has improved  not only the understanding of disease mechanisms but also clinical decision  making in the management of LN.

T1  - Imaging of joints in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 68-73
AB  - Musculoskeletal symptoms are among the most common manifestations in patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), being reported in up to 95% of patients;  joint and tendon involvement can range from arthralgia to severe deforming  arthropathy; while myositis a rare manifestation, comorbid fibromyalgia is  reported in up to 40% of SLE patients. All these manifestations have a  significant impact on the patients' quality of life, possibly leading to  disability and functional impairment in daily living activities. In recent years,  thanks to the availability of new imaging techniques for the assessment of tendon  and joint pathologies, the approach to the definition and characterisation of  these manifestations in SLE is constantly evolving. In this review we will  therefore illustrate the state of the art of imaging techniques in the assessment  of joint involvement in SLE, focusing on ultrasounds (US) and magnetic resonance  (MRI), discussing their advantages, drawbacks and possible future developments.  The main findings that emerge from the recent literature is that imaging studies  may allow a more accurate definition of disease subtypes revealing an unexpected  higher prevalence of joint and tendon involvement with respect to what known by  clinical evaluation and standard radiography. Indeed, US and MRI also made  possible the identification of joints and tendons pathologies in patients with no  or very mild clinical symptoms. On the other hand, the interpretation of some  findings remains uncertain, as well as the validity and feasibility of this  analysis in clinical practice. Thus, further studies should clarify the clinical  meaning of subclinical abnormalities detected in US and MRI scans and their  impact on the long-term outcomes.

SP  - 165-177
AB  - The objective was to evaluate renal involvement in several rheumatic diseases  (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome,  systemic sclerosis, systemic vasculitides). The method chosen was to define  histopathological profiles reported in renal biopsies performed on patients with  renal involvement due to different rheumatic diseases. Renal involvement observed  in patients with rheumatic disease can be the direct result of the disease per se  and/or a complication of drugs used in the disease treatment. The  clinical-pathological correlations derived from the study of renal tissues can be  useful for differential diagnosis, prognosis assessment and therapeutic  decisions. Renal biopsy should be considered as an important tool for the  management of nephropathies in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases.

Following the previous annual reviews, we focused on new insights in  SLE clinical features, pathogenic pathways, biomarkers of specific organ  involvement and therapeutic strategies. We finally concentrated on SLE aspects  that could significantly influence patients' quality of life and that need to be  investigated in detail through the development and validation of disease-specific  patient-reported outcomes.

SP  - 429-436
AB  - There have been many advances in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) over the past decades. Following more than  eleven centuries of therapeutic uncertainty, the discovery of the therapeutic  properties of glucocorticoids is without any doubt one of the most significant  advance in the field of autoimmune diseases. The many progresses made by rapidly  growing chemical industry of the 19th century chemistry have allowed the  identification of valuable therapeutic compounds such as anti-malarials,  cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, cyclosporine and later mycophenolate mofetil,  which have all profoundly changed the face of the disease. A very visible  consequence of this is the profound improvement in the prognosis of the disease,  with 10-year survival rates of more than 90% in most dedicated centres. Following  the development of biotherapies in rheumatoid arthritis, the late 20th century  has slowly opened a new era for the treatment of SLE, that of targeted therapies.  With the approval of belimumab in 2011 and 74 targeted therapies in clinical  development, we may expect great changes in the therapeutic management of SLE.  Those molecules target inflammatory cytokines or chemokines and their receptors,  B cells or plasma cells, intracellular signalling pathways, B/T cells  co-stimulation molecules, interferons, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as well as  various other targets of interest. Current challenges are now slowly shifting  from whether some new drugs will be available to how to select the most adequate  drug (or drug combination) at the patient-level.

SP  - 1613-1621
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Current treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. No disease modifying medications  are licensed for the treatment of LN. Voclosporin, a novel calcineurin inhibitor,  has been investigated as induction therapy in LN in combination with  myocophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a glucocorticoid (GC). Two phase II trials of  voclosporin were the first trials of a potential treatment of active LN that met  their primary endpoints. Areas covered: This article reviews the pharmacology of  voclosporin and the efficacy and safety data from the two existing phase II  trials. In the phase IIb randomized controlled trial AURA-LV, voclosporin was  shown to be superior to placebo, when used in combination with MMF (1-2 g/day)  and GC, in achieving remission in active LN. Expert opinion: While the positive  outcome of existing trials is promising, further data confirming its efficacy and  evaluating its safety are required. A phase III trial is currently recruiting.  Importantly, the positive results were achieved despite a novel and rapid GC  taper regime, suggesting that rapid taper of GC may be a viable treatment option  in active LN which merits further investigation.

T1  - Lupus enteritis as the sole presenting feature of systemic lupus erythematosus: 
SP  - 294-298
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem, autoimmune inflammatory  disease which can affect any organ, including the gastrointestinal tract. Lupus  enteritis is one of the manifestations of gastrointestinal involvement in SLE  patients. However, it is exceedingly rare that lupus enteritis is the sole  initial presentation of SLE. A 12-year-old Thai girl who had had recurrent  abdominal pain for 2 months with no other signs of SLE on initial presentation is  described. A single-balloon enteroscopy demonstrated segmental erythema of the  proximal and mid-jejunum. Histopathology demonstrated active enteritis and  submucosal vasculitis. On the basis of evidence of intestinal vasculitis,  autoimmune profiles were performed; the results supported the possibility of SLE.  She subsequently developed leucopenia, lymphopenia and an oral ulcer, leading to  a robust diagnosis of SLE. Her clinical condition improved dramatically with  prednisolone. Even though lupus enteritis is rare, it can be the initial  presentation of SLE. In young adolescent girls with recurrent abdominal pain, the  possibility of lupus enteritis should be borne in mind.

Systemic lupus  erythematosus predominantly impacts women in their second to fourth decade of  life, with childhood-onset disease being particularly aggressive. Reproductive  issues are an important clinical consideration for pediatric patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as maintaining good disease control and  planning a pregnancy are important for maternal and fetal outcomes. In this  clinical review, we will consider the safety of medications in managing  childhood-onset SLE during conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. The  developing fetus is at highest risk for teratogenicity from maternal medications  during the period of critical organogenesis, which occurs between the first  3-8 weeks following conception. Medications known to be teratogenic, leading to a  specific pattern of malformations, include mycophenolic acid, methotrexate, and  cyclophosphamide. These should be discontinued prior to a planned pregnancy or as  soon as pregnancy is suspected. Hydroxychloroquine is safe and should be  continued throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding in those without  contraindications to it. Azathioprine and calcineurin inhibitors are felt to be  compatible with pregnancy in usual doses and may be used prior to and throughout  pregnancy and lactation. Non-fluorinated corticosteroids including  methylprednisolone and prednisone are inactivated by the placenta and can be used  if needed for maternal indication during gestation. Addition of aspirin may be  considered around the 12th week of gestation for prevention of pre-eclampsia.  Illustrative cases are presented that demonstrate management of adolescents with  childhood-onset SLE through conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.

SP  - 2003-2011
AB  - Fatigue is a common, disabling problem that is highly prevalent in patients with  systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). More recently, vitamin D status has been  established as a potential contributor to SLE pathogenesis and manifestations, in  particular fatigue. This review summarizes the literature regarding the role of  vitamin D in SLE, and provides an overview of the recent literature examining the  association between vitamin D and fatigue in patients with SLE. Finally, the role  of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of SLE-related fatigue is  considered.

T1  - Novel biological therapeutic approaches to cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1041-1047
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) encompasses a spectrum of  dermatologic manifestations which can occur with or without systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). Treatment of CLE is challenging as the traditional  treatments are off label and often fail and there is no drug specifically  approved for CLE. The knowledge gained from the emerging trials on biologic  therapy in SLE has provided insight into the utility of biologic therapy for CLE.  AREAS COVERED: An overview is provided on the biological agents studied for CLE  discussing their immunological target, their efficacy in treating the various CLE  manifestations and the outcome measures used. EXPERT OPINION: There is a paucity  of trials dedicated to the biologic treatment of CLE. Several of the described  biological treatments' efficacy suggests that different clinical phenotypes of  CLE may require different immunological targeted therapies. Recently published  and ongoing trials of SLE focusing on novel agents for CLE using the Cutaneous  Lupus Area and Severity Index (CLASI) as the outcome measure have shown promising  results. Further trials designed specifically to study the efficacy of biologic  treatment in CLE subgroups with or without systemic involvement using specific  metrics for assessing cutaneous involvement are needed and will aid in  illuminating the role of biologic therapy in CLE.

T1  - Subcutaneous belimumab in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1163-1173
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease with various  clinical manifestations, organ involvement and laboratory findings. The disease  can involve any organ including skin, joints, kidneys, central and peripheral  nervous system, cardiovascular system and more. Currently, the cornerstone of  treatment includes antimalarial and immunosuppressive medications and  glucocorticosteroids. Recently, great effort has been invested in finding more  targeted drugs for achieving better control of the disease with less adverse  events. Intravenous belimumab was the first and only biologic drug to be approved  by the US FDA and Health Canada for lupus over the last 50 years, and recently  was studied in subcutaneous form. This paper will review the major belimumab  trials with a focus on the subcutaneous form.

SP  - 1933-1940
AB  - We report two children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) having severe  bleeding manifestations and lupus anticoagulant hypoprothrombinemia syndrome  (LAHPS) along with a review of published cases of childhood SLE and LAHPS. We  report clinical and laboratory profile of two children diagnosed with childhood  SLE and LAHPS. We also conducted literature search to identify similar published  cases and a review was performed. An 8-year-old girl had presented with fever,  arthralgia, alopecia, anasarca and bleeding from multiple sites. She was  diagnosed to have SLE based on laboratory investigations which showed anemia,  thrombocytopenia, low complements, positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and  double standard DNA (dsDNA) antibodies. She was also found to have prolonged  prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), positive  lupus anticoagulant (LA) and low factor II levels. She was diagnosed to have SLE  with LAHPS and treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous  immunoglobulin and cyclophosphamide with good outcome. Patient 2 was a  7-year-old-boy who was diagnosed to have SLE when he presented with fever,  anasarca, malar rash, arthritis and bleeding from skin and mucosa. Laboratory  investigations revealed anemia, proteinuria, low complements, positive ANA and  anti-dsDNA titre. Coagulation studies showed deranged PT and aPTT, positive LA  and low factor II levels. He was diagnosed to have SLE with LAHPS and was treated  with intravenous methylprednisolone and oral mycophenolate mofetil. Review of  literature of cases with childhood SLE and LAHPS showed that there are 32 cases  have been reported till date which have been summarized. LAHPS is an uncommonly  identified cause of bleeding in patients with SLE and must be suspected while  evaluating these children.

T1  - Safety issues and recommendations for successful pregnancy outcome in systemic 
SP  - 16-23
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) primarily affects women of childbearing age.  One of the major changes in SLE focuses on the timing of a successful pregnancy.  In the past, pregnancy was strongly discouraged in SLE, especially in the  presence of risk factors such as nephritis, use of immunosuppressive therapies,  or positivity of specific autoantibodies such as anti-phospholipids and  anti-Ro/SSA, La/SSBA. Thanks to our better knowledge on the disease and  management, pregnancy success rates in SLE patients have significantly improved  care by the a multidisciplinary team which fosters a successful pregnancy with  minimal complications for the mother and fetus when the disease is inactive or in  remission. This approach is based on a counseling phase before pregnancy, to  assess SLE activity phase, specific medications, risk factors, and continues  through pregnancy and lactation with significantly improved pregnancy outcomes.  Further, we can now better define the risk of disease flares during pregnancy  based on a better understanding of the changes in maternal immunity and its  relationship with SLE-associated autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. There is  wide consensus that women with SLE can have successful pregnancies as long as  conception is planned in a phase of inactive disease, and when the patient is  closely managed by a rheumatologist, high-risk OB/GYN, neonatologist, and other  medical specialists as indicated. Preconception counseling is essential to assess  the risk of both fetal and maternal complications as well as identify  life-threatening contraindications. Particular attention should be used in those  SLE cases that have nephritis, APS or positivity for aPL, pulmonary hypertension,  and positive anti-Ro/SSA or anti-La/SSB antibodies. In conclusion, the use of  specific guidelines on the management of SLE before and during pregnancy and  lactation, and a better understanding of the use of immunosuppressive therapies  have significantly increased pregnancy success.

SP  - 989-996
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represents a  challenge due to variable disease manifestations, clinical course, and outcome.  Long-term outcome in SLE remain unsatisfactory and a search for new therapeutic  options is definitely warranted. Despite expectations, most clinical trials  performed in SLE and lupus nephritis in the last decade did not reach primary  outcome, and the only drug that has been licensed is belimumab. AREAS COVERED:  Results of negative trials testing monoclonal antibodies and other biologic  agents in SLE are briefly summarized. Reasons for the failure of the trials are  listed and discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Future studies should recruit patients with  similar organ involvement, better defined disease manifestations, higher  activity, and similar severity. In addition to testing higher efficacy if given  as add-on treatment to standard-of-care, the trials should be aimed at reducing  dosing, or completely eliminating some parts of the current standard treatment,  especially corticosteroids. Median follow-up of the patients should be longer.  Moreover, specific biomarkers are needed to help to identify eligible patients  and to better define response to treatment. An urgent unmet need is testing these  new drugs in patients with severe SLE (including those refractory to current  treatment).

SP  - 467-473
AB  - AIM: To assess the relative efficacy and safety of low-dose cyclophosphamide  (LCYC) and high-dose CYC (HCYC) as induction therapy for lupus nephritis.  METHODS: Bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis was performed to combine  direct and indirect evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining  the efficacy and safety of LCYC, HCYC, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for  induction therapy in patients with lupus nephritis. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs (1212  patients) were included. MMF and LCYC showed similar overall response rates (OR  1.02, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.51-2.02), and MMF showed a higher efficacy  than HCYC (OR 1.48, 95% CrI 0.99-2.44). Similarly, LCYC showed a higher overall  response than HCYC (OR 1.46, 95% CrI 0.83-2.86). Ranking probability based on  SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking curve) indicated that MMF had the  highest probability of being the best treatment for achieving an overall response  (SUCRA = 0.7461), followed by LCYC (SUCRA = 0.6978) and HCYC (SUCRA = 0.0561).  LCYC showed the highest probability of decreasing the risk of serious infections  (SUCRA = 0.8513), followed by MMF (SUCRA = 0.49387) and HCYC (SUCRA = 0.1548).  CONCLUSION: LCYC was an efficacious induction treatment for patients with lupus  nephritis and had the highest probability of decreasing the risk of serious  infections. Higher response rates and a more favorable safety profile suggest  that LCYC is a good option for induction treatment in these patients.

SP  - 711-737
AB  - Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (jSLE), mixed connective tissue disease  (jMCTD), and Sjogren syndrome (jSS) are systemic autoimmune and inflammatory  disorders with distinct patterns of organ involvement. All are characterized by  autoantibody formation, with antinuclear (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA  common in jSLE, ANA with high-titer ribonucleoprotein antibody in jMCTD, and  Sjogren syndrome A and Sjogren syndrome B antibodies + ANA in jSS. Recognition,  monitoring, and management for primary care providers are discussed, focusing on  the role of primary physicians in recognizing and helping maintain optimal health  in children with these potentially life-threatening diseases.

T1  - Monitoring of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Pregnancies: A Systematic Literature 
SP  - 1477-1490
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few data exist to guide the frequency and type of monitoring in  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pregnancies. A systematic literature review  was performed to address this gap in the literature. METHODS: A systematic review  of original articles (1975-2015) was performed using Medline, Embase, and  Cochrane Library. We included search terms for SLE, pregnancy, and monitoring. We  also hand-searched reference lists, review articles, and grey literature for  additional relevant articles. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 1106  articles. After removing 117 duplicates, 929 articles that were evidently  unrelated to our topic based on title and/or abstract, and 7 that were in a  language other than English or French, 53 articles were included for full-text  review. Following a more in-depth review, 15 were excluded: 6 did not use any  measure of SLE activity and 6 did not specifically address SLE monitoring in  pregnancy; 1 case series, 1 review, and 1 metaanalysis were removed. Among the 38  included studies, presence of active disease, antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies  positivity, and abnormal uterine and umbilical artery Doppler studies predicted  poor pregnancy outcomes. No studies evaluated an evidence-based approach to the  frequency of monitoring. CONCLUSION: Few existing studies address monitoring for  optimal care during SLE pregnancies. The available data imply roles for aPL  antibodies measurement (prior to pregnancy and/or during the first trimester),  uterine and umbilical artery Doppler studies in the second trimester, and  following disease activity. Optimal frequency of monitoring is not addressed in  the existing literature.

AB  - Oral signs are frequently the first manifestation of autoimmune diseases. For  this reason, dentists play an important role in the detection of emerging  autoimmune pathologies. Indeed, an early diagnosis can play a decisive role in  improving the quality of treatment strategies as well as quality of life. This  can be obtained thanks to specific knowledge of oral manifestations of autoimmune  diseases. This review is aimed at describing oral presentations, diagnosis, and  treatment strategies for systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome,  pemphigus vulgaris, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and Behcet disease.

T1  - Hair and Scalp Changes in Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 679-694
AB  - Cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly involves the hair and  scalp. Alopecia can result from direct activity of disease on the scalp or from  the state of physical stress in the form of telogen effluvium. Discoid lupus  erythematosus and lupus panniculitis/profundus are known to cause scarring  alopecia, while accumulation of recent studies has shown that non-scarring  alopecia in SLE may have different subtypes, comprising lupus  erythematosus-specific and lupus erythematosus-nonspecific changes on histology.  This review aims to summarize the clinical pattern, trichoscopic,  histopathological, and direct immunofluorescence features of different types of  alopecia in cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as exploring  their relationship with SLE disease activity.

T1  - Emerging targets for the treatment of lupus erythematosus: There is no royal road 
SP  - 60-69
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a highly heterogeneous autoimmune disease  that preferentially affects women of child-bearing age. Most current treatments  for SLE with the exception of belimumab are not target-specific. Nontargeted  therapy such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and other immunosuppressive  drugs results in unwanted adverse effects. Although progress in treatment,  including supportive therapy, has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients  with SLE, better treatment drugs and protocols with fewer adverse effects and  higher efficacy for the most severe form of SLE are needed. Advancements in  genomics, immunology, and pathophysiology in the field of systemic autoimmunity  have provided physicians with increasing knowledge, but the most appropriate  treatment for each patient with SLE remains to be established. Therefore, the  search for novel treatment targets in patients with SLE is ongoing. This review  focuses on recent findings in the genetics of lupus and the abnormalities in  cellular interactions, cytokine profiles, and intracellular signaling in patients  with SLE. Novel molecular targets for lupus, mostly introduced through clinical  trials, are then discussed based on these findings.

SP  - 228-239
AB  - The autoimmune rheumatological diseases rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  spondyloarthritis (SpA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are treated with  conventional immunosuppressive agents and with modern biological  immunomodulators. The latter group of medications have brought about a major  change in our ability to control RA and SpA, with more modest results for SLE.  The biologicals are very specific in their mechanisms of action, targeting one  specific cytokine or one particular cellular marker. Because of this, their  efficacy can readily be linked to a single immunomodulatory mechanism. This  observation has fuelled hopes that the efficacy of these agents can be predicted  at the individual level based on the patient's genetic predisposition,  immunological profile or disease phenotype. Whilst the biologic therapies have  improved the prospects for patients with these diseases very significantly, the  hope that they could be targeted to the patient in an individualized manner has  not completely born fruit. In this review, I will argue that we are witnessing  important progress in this field, and that justified hope exists for true  advances in precision medicine in the autoimmune diseases in the coming years.

T1  - Induction therapy for membranous lupus nephritis: a systematic review and network 
SP  - 1163-1172
AB  - AIM: Membranous lupus glomerulonephritis (MLN) is associated with morbidities  such as thromboembolism, peripheral edema and/or hyperlipidemia. However,  treatment of MLN remains elusive. METHODS: We performed systematic searches on  MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library database up to November, 2017. Eligible  studies included randomized trials or cohort studies which evaluated different  immunosuppressants in adult patients with pathologically proved MLN. No language  restrictions were applied. Endpoints included complete remission (CR) as the  primary outcome, and CR plus partial remission (PR) and proteinuria-reducing  effect as secondary outcomes. Frequentist estimation of a network meta-analysis  (NMA) random-effect model was performed. RESULTS: Eight studies (206 patients)  were included with a total of six immunosuppressants as an induction therapy for  MLN. NMA results showed that both mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and calcineurin  inhibitors (CNI) are effective in the induction of CR and CR plus PR when  compared with corticosteroids (CS) alone, but MMF and CNI are also associated  with higher infection rates when compared with CS. CONCLUSION: Our NMA  demonstrated that both MMF and CNI are more effective than CS for induction  therapy in MLN patients. However, there are limitations due to intra- and  inter-study variability.

T1  - Glucocorticoids and antimalarials in systemic lupus erythematosus: an update and 
SP  - 482-489
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is highlighting the most recent  evidence on the clinical efficacy and toxicity of glucocorticoids and  antimalarials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and provide recommendations  on their current use. RECENT FINDINGS: Glucocorticoid toxicity is well known.  Recent data confirm the increased risk of infection and damage accrual. An  observational study form Hong Kong has seen increased mortality among users of  high-dose prednisone regimes. Several studies support the efficacy of medium-low  doses and methyl-prednisolone pulses in lupus patients, both with and without  nephritis.New data confirm the effects of antimalarials in preventing SLE  activity, damage and infections, and in decreasing mortality. New screening  recommendations for hydroxychloroquine maculopathy have been recently published.  Combining mepacrine and hydroxychloroquine in patients with refractory cutaneous  and/or articular lupus activity has proved highly effective. SUMMARY: Universal  therapy with hydroxychloroquine should be aimed to patients with SLE without  contraindications. Doses greater than 4 mg/kg/day should be avoided and regular  eye screening warranted to minimize the risk of macular toxicity. Every effort  should be made to reduce the dose of oral glucocorticoids. In moderate-severe  flares, pulse methyl-prednisolone are more effective and much less toxic than  increasing the oral doses of prednisone.

T1  - Important considerations in pregnant patients with lupus nephritis.
SP  - 489-498
AB  - In the last few decades, identification of predictors of pregnancy outcome and  appropriate pregnancy planning have significantly reduced the maternal and fetal  risks in pregnant women with lupus nephritis. Areas covered: Successful  pregnancies have been reported even in women with chronic renal disease and renal  insufficiency. However, refractory hypertension and severe renal or cardiac  chronic dysfunction are still considered contraindications to pregnancy. Pre-term  delivery and fetal growth restriction may still occur in SLE patients more  frequently than in healthy women, even in pregnancies regularly planned and  monitored by a team of nephrologists and gynaecologists. Expert commentary:  Stable disease remission is the most important factor for a successful pregnancy.  In case of flare-ups of lupus, timely diagnosis and appropriate management may  ensure a successful outcome in the majority of pregnant women. The negative role  of anti-phospholipid antibodies and of chronic arterial hypertension may be  countered with appropriate anticoagulation and anti-hypertensive therapy. Further  studies are needed to better assess the possible impact of pregnancy on the  long-term outcome of lupus nephritis.

T1  - Clinical application of protein biomarkers in lupus erythematosus and lupus 
SP  - 1582-1590
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a type of autoimmune disease that damages  multiple organs, including the heart, joints, liver and kidneys. The main  characteristics of SLE are the deposition of circulating autoantibodies;  autoantigen complexes in the renal system; and abnormal expression of  complements, cytokines and chemokines. Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most serious  manifestation of SLE and is characterized by inflammation of the kidney. This  review summarizes recent clinical applications of protein biomarkers including  autoantibodies, complements, cytokines and chemokines and some new protein  biomarkers in SLE and LN. The clinical differential diagnosis of protein  biomarkers related to prognosis and diagnosis is discussed and highlighted.  Protein biomarkers play crucial roles in the study of SLE and LN. Useful  biomarkers will provide insights into effective treatments for these diseases.

In this review,  we consider newer biologic approaches that might offer the hope of improving the  outcome of SLE patients. These include the fully humanized anti-CD20 mAbs,  PEGylated anti-CD40L, IFNalpha inhibitors, rigerimod and immune complexes blockade.

T1  - Future Perspectives in the Diagnosis of Neuropsychiatric Lupus by Advanced 
SP  - 213-218
AB  - Neuropsychiatric (NP) syndromes are an important cause of morbi-mortality in  patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Despite remarkable recent  progress, there are no definite methods to diagnose neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE)  or to differentiate primary NPSLE from secondary causes. NPSLE remains a  diagnosis of exclusion, and the clinical judgment is still the main approach to  the correct diagnosis. Within this complex context, the Magnetic Resonance  Imaging (MRI) has both a diagnostic role, by showing the nervous system  involvement on one hand and excluding other causes on the other hand, and a  prognostic role, help in assessing the lesions and monitoring the evolution.  Conventional MRI shows brain involvement in around half of the patients, although  the described findings are rather non-specific and present in many other  diseases. However, many advanced MRI techniques are becoming increasingly used  over the last period, showing abnormalities even in normal-appearing brains on  conventional MRI. These MRI techniques hold promise to have a higher sensitivity  and specificity than conventional MRI for NPSLE related changes. This review  explores the place and the future perspectives of different advanced MRI  techniques in NPSLE.

T1  - Lupus Nephritis: A Treatment Update.
SP  - 4-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common complication in many patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus, although renal-limited lupus nephritis has been  reported as well. Early diagnosis of lupus nephritis is critical as early  detection and effective treatment can improve renal outcomes in such patients.  OBJECTIVE: The treatment of lupus nephritis is largely determined based on the  histological class present on the renal biopsy specimen. In most cases, Class I  and II of lupus nephritis do not require any specific treatment, but class III  and IV lupus nephritis require immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment of Class V  and VI remains controversial. In 2012, six guidelines were introduced for the  management of lupus nephritis. These guidelines offer comprehensive treatment  plans for each class of Lupus nephritis but differ from each other in many  aspects. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature of the  available pharmacological treatments used in the six classes of lupus nephritis  as well as resistant lupus nephritis, strategies to address the problems of  inadequate therapeutic response, medication related side effects, relapses of  lupus nephritis, and some future treatment options. METHODS: We reviewed the  available literature and treatment guidelines on lupus nephritis in detail to  present a comprehensive review of the available treatment options for different  classes of lupus nephritis. CONCLUSION: Lupus nephritis which does not respond to  initial treatment is associated with worse renal outcomes. Several therapeutic  approaches are available for the induction and maintenance immunosuppression of  the different classes of LN. Management of LN should be individualized for each  patient based on their risk-benefit profile.

T1  - The gut microbiome and elevated cardiovascular risk in obesity and autoimmunity.
SP  - 203-213
AB  - Cardiovascular disease associated with obesity and autoimmunity is the leading  cause of death in these populations and significant residual risk remains despite  current treatment approaches. Obesity, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are linked to  chronic inflammation, and subjects with these disorders have characteristic  shifts in their gut microbiome composition. Recent data suggest that alterations  in gut microbial and metabolic composition may be responsible, in part, for  induction of chronic inflammation, thus promoting cardiovascular disease. Common  microbiome changes observed in obesity, T1DM, RA, and SLE include a decrease in  the ratio of bacteria, such as Gram-positive Firmicutes to Gram-negative  Bacteroidetes, as well as an overabundance or depletion of certain species,  including Prevotella copri. The consequent effects of these shifts include  alterations in the metabolic composition of the gut, hyper-activation of  toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), upregulation of inflammatory pathways, e.g. c-Jun  N-terminal kinase and nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB), increased intestinal  permeability, increased C-reactive protein, and increased levels of  trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Differential microbiome compositions may also  explain sex differences observed in autoimmunity, where a male gut microbiome  promotes anti-inflammatory processes as compared to a female pro-inflammatory gut  microbiome. Intervention at the level of the microbiota appears to attenuate  symptoms in these inflammatory syndromes with probiotic treatment, such as  Lactobacilli, playing a uniquely beneficial role in restoring intestinal health,  decreasing inflammation, and reducing cardiovascular disease. This review will  discuss obesity, T1DM, RA, and SLE in the context of how each unique microbiome  profile contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk.

T1  - Effectiveness, Tolerability, and Safety of Belimumab in Patients with Refractory 
SP  - 331-343
AB  - To date, belimumab is the only biological drug approved for the treatment of  patients with active refractory SLE. We compared and critically analyzed the  results of 11 observational clinical-practice-based studies, conducted in SLE  referral centers. Despite the differences in endpoints and follow-up duration,  all studies remarked that belimumab provides additional benefits when used as an  add-on to existing treatment, allowing a higher rate of patients to reach  remission and to taper or discontinue corticosteroids. In the OBSErve studies,  2-9.6% of patients discontinued corticosteroids and 72-88.4% achieved a >/= 20%  improvement by physician's judgment at 6 months. In Hui-Yuen's study, 51% of  patients attained response by simplified SRI at month 6. In Sthoeger's study,  72.3% of patients discontinued corticosteroids and 69.4% achieved clinical  remission by PGA after a median follow-up of 2.3 years. In the multicentric  Italian study, 77 and 68.7% of patients reached SRI-4 response at months 6 and  12, respectively. In all the studies, disease activity indices decreased over  time. Retention rates at 6, 9, and 12 months were 82-94.1, 61.2-83.3, and  56.7-79.2%, respectively. The main limitations of these studies include the lack  of a control group, the short period of observation (6-24 months) and the lack of  precise restrictions regarding concomitant medication management. This  notwithstanding, these experiences provide a more realistic picture of real-life  effectiveness of the drug compared with the randomized controlled clinical  trials, where stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria and changes in background  therapy could limit the inference of data to the routine clinical care.

SP  - 789-796
AB  - We present a consensus report pertaining to the improved clarity of definitions  and classification of glomerular lesions in lupus nephritis that derived from a  meeting of 18 members of an international nephropathology working group in  Leiden, Netherlands, in 2016. Here we report detailed recommendations on issues  for which we can propose adjustments based on existing evidence and current  consensus opinion (phase 1). New definitions are provided for mesangial  hypercellularity and for cellular, fibrocellular, and fibrous crescents. The term  "endocapillary proliferation" is eliminated and the definition of endocapillary  hypercellularity considered in some detail. We also eliminate the class IV-S and  IV-G subdivisions of class IV lupus nephritis. The active and chronic  designations for class III/IV lesions are replaced by a proposal for activity and  chronicity indices that should be applied to all classes. In the activity index,  we include fibrinoid necrosis as a specific descriptor. We also make  recommendations on issues for which there are limited data at present and that  can best be addressed in future studies (phase 2). We propose to proceed to these  investigations, with clinicopathologic studies and tests of interobserver  reproducibility to evaluate the applications of the proposed definitions and to  classify lupus nephritis lesions.

SP  - 221-239
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review, and conduct a meta-analysis of  steroid-sparing effect in, phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of  biologic therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Studies were  identified by searching Medline (via Pubmed), EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS  databases, the Cochrane library, and clinicaltrials.gov. Adult human studies  published in English in the last ten years (until 18/04/2017) were included. A  random-effects meta-analysis comparing a common corticosteroid-reduction endpoint  in the trials of rituximab, belimumab, tabalumab and epratuzumab in SLE, was  conducted. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were identified; nine were conducted in  SLE, five in lupus nephritis and the remaining 14 were post hoc analyses of phase  3 trials in SLE. All therapies trialed targeted B-cells (rituximab (anti-CD20  monoclonal antibody (mAb)), belimumab (anti-BAFF mAb), tabalumab (anti-BAFF mAb),  epratuzumab (anti-CD22 mAb), atacicept (TACI-Ig), ocrelizumab (anti-CD20 mAb)),  except for abetimus sodium and abatacept (CTLA4-Ig). Only the three trials of  belimumab met their primary endpoints, although benefit in secondary endpoints  and reduction in serological activity was often seen in the other studies.  Meta-analysis showed that most therapies (belimumab, tabalumab, and epratuzumab)  had a steroid-sparing effect, compared to placebo (pooled RR 1.36 (1.19, 1.56),  I(2) = 0, p < 0.67). Therapies were generally well tolerated; however, three  studies were terminated prematurely due to serious side effects. CONCLUSIONS:  With the exception of belimumab, none of the phase 3 trials of biologic therapy  in SLE have met their primary endpoint. However, the significant steroid-sparing  effect of these agents suggests that future trials may need to include steroid  dose in a composite primary endpoint.

T1  - Belimumab: A Review in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 355-366
AB  - Belimumab (Benlysta((R))) is a human immunoglobulin G1lambda monoclonal antibody that  inhibits the binding of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator to B cells. It is the  only biological agent currently approved for the treatment of non-renal systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). Belimumab is approved in the EU, the USA and other  countries as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive  SLE despite standard therapy. In phase III trials, treatment with IV or SC  belimumab plus standard therapy was effective in terms of reducing overall  disease activity and reducing the incidence and severity of flares, without  worsening of patients' overall condition or the development of significant  disease activity in new organ systems. Sustained disease control was maintained  during longer-term (up to 10 years) treatment with IV belimumab. Belimumab also  demonstrated steroid-sparing effects and was associated with clinically  meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life and fatigue. Belimumab  was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with low rates of  immunogenicity. In view of the flexibility regarding the route of administration  and the convenience of the once-weekly, self-administered, SC regimen, add-on  therapy with belimumab is a useful treatment option for patients with active,  autoantibody-positive SLE despite standard therapy.

T1  - Systematic evaluation of different doses of cyclophosphamide induction therapy 
SP  - e9408
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study systemically evaluated the efficacy and safety of  intermittent intravenous pulse therapy with different doses of cyclophosphamide  (CTX) for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: We screened the Chinese  Journal Full-text Database (CNKI, 1994-present), China Biology Medicine (CBMdisc,  1978-present), VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (1989-present),  PubMed (1948-present), MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946-present), Embase (1947-present),  and the Cochrane controlled trials register (13, 2017). Literature reports were  selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, effective data were  extracted, research quality was evaluated, and RevMan5.2 was used for  meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled studies were included,  consisting of 655 patients. The meta-analysis results showed no significant  differences between the low- and high-dose cyclophosphamide groups in partial,  complete, and total remission rates as well Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease  Activity Index (SLEDAI). Furthermore, there were no significant differences  between the 2 groups in hematologic toxicity and gastrointestinal reaction, but  the risk of infection (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI],  0.56-0.98, total effect inspection Z = 2.12, P = .03), and menstrual disorder  (RR = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.31-0.69, total effect inspection Z = 3.83, P = .0001)  decreased in the low-dose cyclophosphamide group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no  obvious difference between the low- and high-dose cyclophosphamide groups in  efficacy in the treatment of lupus nephritis, but the risk of infection and  menstrual disorder significantly decreased in the low-dose group.

T1  - [Unmet needs in systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 396-407
AB  -   Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease involving multiple  lesions that cause inflammation and the production of autoantibodies. Lupus  nephritis (LN) and neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) are common organ-threatening  manifestations of SLE and result in significant morbidity and mortality. In the  last 30 years, steroids and immunosuppressive drugs have improved the prognosis  of patients with SLE, and today the 5-year survival rate exceeds 90%. However,  the treatment of SLE still largely depends on these medications and sometimes  results in death due to complications. In recent years, biologic agents and  low-molecular-weight compounds have emerged that are expected to be effective  against refractory LN and NPSLE. For the diagnosis of SLE, the classification  revised in 1997 proposed by the American College of Rheumatology and the  classification standards of the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating  Clinics 2012 classification criteria have been used, but they are not necessarily  useful for early diagnosis. New biomarkers are needed for the early diagnosis of  SLE. In this article, we summarize the unmet needs of diagnosis and treatment  with SLE, especially those with LN and NPSLE, with data from our own experiences.

SP  - 779-782
AB  - This review deals with the neuropsychiatric disorders resulting from systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that impacts all  systems in the human body, including the central nervous system. Neuropsychiatric  symptoms in SLE are a common complication of the disease. This complication has  significant implications for the severity of the illness. In most cases no  thorough psychiatric assessment is performed during initial evaluation of the  disease and no protocol or clear guidelines for treating the psychiatric symptoms  in SLE are available. Early diagnosis of the psychiatric symptoms in SLE is  critical since absence of treatment may result in severe psychiatric  complications. Clinical pharmacological studies are needed in order to develop  guidelines for treating psychiatric symptoms in SLE.

T1  - Lupus podocytopathy: a distinct entity of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 629-634
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients clinically presenting with nephrotic  syndrome demonstrating minimal change disease (MCD), mesangial proliferation  (MsP) or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), while on electronic  microscopy, diffuse podocyte foot process effacement in absence of sub-epithelial  or sub-endothelial deposition is the only morphological feature and now diagnosed  as lupus podocytopathy. Lupus podocytopathy with glomerular morphology of MCD or  MsP usually presents with typical nephrotic syndrome and sensitive to  glucocorticoid treatment, but the relapse rate could reach up to 90% on  maintenance treatment with glucocorticoid alone. Glucocorticoid plus other  immunosuppressive agents could significantly decrease the relapse rate. Lupus  podocytopathy with FSGS presents with a higher rate of acute kidney injury and  less sensitivity to glucocorticoid treatment. The long-term outcomes of lupus  podocytopathy are optimistic, but pathological transition could occur after renal  relapses. The unique clinical and morphological features of lupus podocytopathy  indicate that this special SLE-associated glomerulopathy should be included in  the upcoming revised pathological classification of lupus nephritis.

T1  - Early cutaneous eruptions after oral hydroxychloroquine in a lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 344-348
AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective treatment of lupus erythematosus.  Although adverse effects, mainly gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations,  are rare, they may result in the cessation of medication in some patients with  severe reactions. Therefore, the evaluation of a patient's condition is important  for a dermatologist to decide whether to cease or continue HCQ. We herein report  a case of a 36-year-old Japanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and  cutaneous eruptions caused by the p.o. administration of HCQ. Because she wanted  to continue the medication and had only mild cutaneous eruptions without any  adverse effects in other organs, we continued HCQ with careful monitoring. All  cutaneous eruptions disappeared within 1 week. We also reviewed published case  reports on skin lesions that developed after HCQ treatments, and propose  strategies for early cutaneous eruptions after HCQ treatments. When the cutaneous  reactions are mild without any reactions in other organs, withdrawal of the drug  is not required. However, when cutaneous eruptions are accompanied by some common  reactions, HCQ needs to be stopped for a period of time and may subsequently be  carefully re-administrated.

T1  - Pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome.
SP  - 397-414
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease  with a high prevalence in females of childbearing age. Pregnancy in SLE nowadays  has favorable outcomes for the majority of women. However, flares of disease  activity, preeclampsia, fetal loss, and preterm birth are well-known risks in  such pregnancies. Anti-SS-A(Ro)/SS-B(La) antibodies put fetuses at risk for  congenital heart block and neonatal lupus. Several risk factors for adverse  pregnancy outcomes have been identified. Women with antiphospholipid antibodies  or antiphospholipid syndrome and lupus nephritis represent a group with high risk  for obstetric complications. Factors such as appropriate preconception counseling  and medication adjustment, strict disease control prior to pregnancy, and  intensive surveillance during and after pregnancy are essential to improve  pregnancy outcome. The aim of this review article is to update on the medical  care of pregnancy in these women to ensure the best maternal and fetal prognosis.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease  characterized by autoantibodies directed against numerous self-nuclear antigens.  Because of the heterogeneous nature of lupus, it has been challenging to identify  markers that are sensitive and specific enough for its diagnosis and monitoring.  However, with the sequencing of the human genome, rapid development of  high-throughput approaches has allowed for a better understanding of the  etiopathogenesis of complex diseases, including SLE. Here we present a review of  the latest advancements in biomarker discovery during the "omics" era, using  these novel technologies, for assisting in the diagnosis and prognosis of  patients with SLE.

T1  - An evidence-based approach to pre-pregnancy counselling for patients with 
SP  - 1707-1720
AB  - Patients with SLE are often young females of childbearing age and a pregnancy  wish in this patient group is common. However, SLE patients are at high risk for  adverse pregnancy outcomes that require adequate guidance. It is widely  acknowledged that pre-pregnancy counselling is the pivotal first step in the  management of SLE patients with a wish to become pregnant. Next, management of  these patients is usually multidisciplinary and often requires specific expertise  from the different physicians involved. Very recently a EULAR recommendation was  published emphasizing the need for adequate preconception counselling and risk  stratification. Therefore the present review specifically addresses the issue of  pre-pregnancy counselling for SLE patients with an evidence-based approach. The  review summarizes data retrieved from recently published, high-quality cohort  studies that have contributed to a better understanding and estimation of  pregnancy-related risks for SLE patients. The present review categorizes risks  from a patient-oriented point of view, that is, the influence of pregnancy on  SLE, of SLE on pregnancy, of SLE on the foetus/neonate and of SLE-related  medication. Lastly, pre-pregnancy counselling of SLE patients with additional  secondary APS is reviewed. Collectively these data can guide clinicians to  formulate appropriate preventive strategies and patient-tailored monitoring plans  during pre-pregnancy counselling of SLE patients.

SP  - 153-162
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the relationships between vitamin D status and systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) concerning immunological, clinical aspects and possible  effects of supplementation in disease modulation. METHODS: The literature was  reviewed up to January 2017 for studies regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis,  immunological aspects, clinical implications and supplementation strategies. The  focus was mainly on studies with implications on every day clinical practice.  RESULTS: Vitamin D interacts with immune system mechanisms, therefore, it may be  involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The literature is concordant  on vitamin D insufficiency being endemic in SLE patients. Data on the correlation  between SLE disease activity and circulating levels of vitamin D are  controversial, as well as those related to the immunomodulatory effects of  vitamin D supplementation. Novel areas of study are the relationship between  constitutional symptoms and cognitive involvement of SLE and hypovitaminosis D,  and the possible role of vitamin D in the formation of the atherosclerotic  plaque, opening new avenues for the modulation of the cardiovascular risk.  CONCLUSIONS: Future studies are needed to fully understand the relationship  between hypovitaminosis D and different aspects of SLE. The most challenging  topic will be to clarify supplementation strategies with vitamin D analogues that  can be effective in modulating disease activity.

T1  - Intravenous thrombolysis in SLE-related stroke: a case report and literature 
SP  - 155-159
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) bear an increased risk of  ischemic stroke. However, evidences for treating acute stroke due to artery  thrombosis in SLE patients are extremely limited. A 45-year-old woman experienced  sudden left hemiplegia. She was transported to the emergency department of our  hospital 2 hours after the initial symptom. According to the medical records, the  patient was diagnosed with SLE at the age of 28. CT scanned 150 min after the  initial symptom showed no evidence of acute changes or hemorrhage. Magnetic  resonance angiography (MRA) revealed occlusion of the right proximal middle  cerebral artery (MCA). Ischemic stroke was diagnosed and NIHSS scored 11. The  occluded MCA was successfully recanalized with intravenous rtPA. Sequent vascular  imaging and serological results indicated that the etiology of the occlusion in  right MCA was SLE vasculitis. The patient attained a mRS of 3 at the 3-month  follow-up. The case is the first one in the literature that acute ischemic stroke  related to SLE vasculitis was treated successfully with intravenous rtPA  thrombolysis. The feasibility of intravenous thrombolysis for stroke related to  SLE warrant further study.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus with and without a family history: a meta-analysis.
SP  - 716-721
AB  - Objective The objective of this paper is to investigate the association of  clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters between familial systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and sporadic SLE. Methods All relevant literature was  retrieved from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and China National Knowledge  Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The qualities of these studies were evaluated  using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The characteristics and  clinical manifestations of involved individuals were extracted from each study.  Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated using the random effects-method, and the  heterogeneity between studies was quantified using the I(2) statistic. Results Of  330 studies identified by the search strategy, six were included in this review.  In total, 733 cases were familial SLE and 1405 were sporadic SLE. Analysis  revealed that photosensitivity, nephritis and thrombocytopenia were negatively  associated with familial SLE, with OR (95% CI) values of 0.73 (0.60-0.89), 0.72  (0.59-0.88) and 0.75 (0.57-0.98), respectively. Conclusions Photosensitivity,  thrombocytopenia and renal involvement could be more common in non-familial SLE,  which should be further confirmed by well-designed studies with large  populations.

Only  four cases of intussusception with SLE have been reported in literature. Here, we  describe a new case of a patient with ileocecal intussusception merged with SLE,  who was diagnosed using abdominal computed tomography and successfully treated  with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and pulse methylprednisolone.

T1  - Echocardiography in Infective Endocarditis: State of the Art.
SP  - 127
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we examine the central role of  echocardiography in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of infective  endocarditis (IE). RECENT FINDINGS: 2D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and  transesophageal echocardiography TEE have complementary roles and are  unequivocally the mainstay of diagnostic imaging in IE. The advent of 3D and  multiplanar imaging have greatly enhanced the ability of the imager to evaluate  cardiac structure and function. Technologic advances in 3D imaging allow for the  reconstruction of realistic anatomic images that in turn have positively impacted  IE-related surgical planning and intervention. CT and metabolic imaging appear to  be emerging as promising ancillary diagnostic tools that could be deployed in  select scenarios to circumvent some of the limitations of echocardiography. Our  review summarizes the indispensable and central role of various echocardiographic  modalities in the management of infective endocarditis. The complementary role of  2D TTE and TEE are discussed and areas where 3D TEE offers incremental value  highlighted. An algorithm summarizing a contemporary approach to the workup of  endocarditis is provided and major societal guidelines for timing of surgery are  reviewed.

T1  - Predictive biological markers of systemic lupus erythematosus flares: a 
SP  - 238
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify the most reliable biomarkers in  the literature that could be used as flare predictors in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed  using two databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) through April 2015 and congress  abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology and the European League  Against Rheumatism were reviewed from 2010 to 2014. Two independent reviewers  screened titles and abstracts and analysed selected papers in detail, using a  specific questionnaire. Reports addressing the relationships between one or more  defined biological test(s) and the occurrence of disease exacerbation were  included in the systematic review. RESULTS: From all of the databases, 4668  records were retrieved, of which 69 studies or congress abstracts were selected  for the systematic review. The performance of seven types of biomarkers performed  routinely in clinical practice and nine types of novel biological markers was  evaluated. Despite some encouraging results for anti-double-stranded DNA  antibodies, anti-C1q antibodies, B-lymphocyte stimulator and tumour necrosis  factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis, none of the biomarkers stood out from the  others as a potential gold standard for flare prediction. The results were  heterogeneous, and a lack of standardized data prevented us from identifying a  powerful biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: No powerful conclusions could be drawn from this  systematic review due to a lack of standardized data. Efforts should be  undertaken to optimize future research on potential SLE biomarkers to develop  validated candidates. Thus, we propose a standardized pattern for future studies.

T1  - The multifactorial origin of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in 
SP  - 2105-2114
AB  - The cyclophosphamide as a predisposing factor for Posterior Reversible  Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) and therapeutic option for systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) is still confusing. The first and only case of PRES, probably  induced by cyclophosphamide, in Croatia followed by the findings of 36 SLE  patients diagnosed with PRES after treatment with cyclophosphamide worldwide are  described. An 18-year-old Caucasian female patient with a 1-year history of SLE  was admitted to the hospital due to lupus nephritis and acute arthritis. After  the second dose of cyclophosphamide was administered, according to the Euro-lupus  protocol, the patient presented with a grand mal status epilepticus. The  differential diagnosis of neurolupus, cerebrovascular insult, and infection were  excluded. The MRI findings showed brain changes in corresponding to PRES. The  treatment consisted of antihypertensives, antiepileptics, antiedema therapy,  mechanical ventilation, and avoiding further cyclophosphamide use. A Naranjo  Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale total score of five and a probable  reaction related to drug therapy (cyclophosphamide, PRES) was confirmed. In this  systematic review, along with cyclophosphamide use, the main predisposing factors  involved in PRES occurrence in SLE patients were active SLE and renal  involvement. Due to the high number of simultaneously involved predisposing  factors (max. six) and their overlapping effect, it is still not possible to  clearly establish the role of every factor on PRES onset. The use of  cyclophosphamide, as a contributing factor for PRES onset, should be carefully  assessed, based on clinicians' experience and knowledge, in the setting of active  SLE.

T1  - Effect of vitamin D supplementation on patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 466-471
AB  - The objective of this systematic review was to analyze clinical trials carried  out for the investigation of the effect of vitamin D supplementation on systemic  lupus erythematosus. The research was performed from August to September 2016,  without limits regarding year of publication, restriction of gender, age, and  ethnicity. For the guiding question, the PICO strategy was employed. To evaluate  the quality of the publications the PRISMA protocol and Jadad scale were used.  The risk of bias analysis of the clinical trials was performed using the Cochrane  collaboration tool. After the process of article selection and removal of  duplicates, four articles were identified as eligible. The results of three  studies showed a positive effect of supplementation on disease activity reduction  and significant improvement in levels of inflammatory markers, fatigue, and  endothelial function. Only one study showed no improvement in disease activity  after supplementation. Moreover, all studies showed an increase in serum vitamin  D levels. The data from this review provide evidence on the benefits of vitamin D  supplementation in patients with lupus and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency.  However, it is still necessary to elucidate whether vitamin D acts in the  protection against this metabolic disorder, as well as the standardization of the  type, dose and time of vitamin D supplementation.

T1  - Heart failure in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 187-197
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a  constellation of cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV manifestations. Even though CV  complications such as accelerated atherosclerosis and elevated risk of myocardial  infarction (MI) have been recognized for many years, there is limited evidence  regarding SLE and its association with heart failure (HF). Traditional risk  factors of atherosclerotic CV disease, as well as various SLE manifestations and  therapies, independently or together, increase the risk of HF in this population.  There is a need for sufficiently powered intervention studies focusing on  specific risk factors to improve CV outcomes in SLE patients.

T1  - Use of eculizumab in a systemic lupus erythemathosus patient presenting 
SP  - 2859-2867
AB  - The association of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) has been described in 0.5 to 10% of cases, and patients  present worse outcome. TMA is described as the association of microangiopathic  hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an organ injury, frequently the kidney.  This study describes a successful case of use of eculizumab in a patient with SLE  and TMA refractory to standard therapy, and provides a literature review. Case  description and search in PubMed and MEDLINE using systemic lupus erythemathous  and/or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and eculizumab retrieved 15 case reports.  Eighteen-year-old female presented acute renal failure and TMA and was diagnosed  with SLE. Steroids and IV cyclophosphamide were started together with plasma  exchange. After 55 days, she still persisted with microangiopathic anemia,  thrombocytopenia, and anuria, and eculizumab was introduced. She had rapid  improvement in hematological parameters, and dialysis was discontinued 25 days  after the first dose. Genetic analysis showed large heterozygous deletion  encompassing the entire CFHR1 and CFHR3, a finding previously associated with  patients presenting atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (aHUS). Twenty patients  who received eculizumab with SLE and/or APS have been published to date: 11 were  female and mean age at presentation was 31 years. Seven out of the 20 patients  presented only SLE, 5 patients only APS and 8 patients both SLE and APS. Eighteen  patients underwent plasma exchange, with a mean of 20 (4-120) sessions per  patient. Thirteen patients received rituximab. Hematological response was evident  in 100% and kidney recovery in 85% of patients. The terminal complement blockade  with eculizumab is an optional treatment for patients with SLE and/or APS  presenting TMA and refractory to current immunosuppression therapies. Genetic  testing may help recognize patients with aHUS and SLE/APS and therefore help to  determine length of treatment with eculizumab.

T1  - Bone mineral density and vitamin D status in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): 
SP  - 1155-1159
AB  - Despite the improvement in the quality of life of patients with SLE due to  scientific and technological advances, SLE remains a disease that over the years  may produce irreversible damage to patients. Osteoporosis and secondary bone  fractures are two of the major causes of irreparable injury in patients with SLE.  Vitamin D insufficiency may play a vital role both in reduced bone mineral  density (BMD) and in the appearance of fractures, although its mechanisms of  action are still unclear. We performed a systematic review of the literature in  order to determine the prevalence and predictors of reduced vitamin D plasma  levels, bone loss and the presence of fractures in SLE patients. Our review  encompassed all English-language publications using Medline and EMBase electronic  databases from their inception (1966 and 1980, respectively) to December 2016. We  included all intervention studies and observational studies in which vitamin D  plasma levels, BMD and bone loss were measured and applied to patients with SLE.  Previous studies suggested an increase in bone loss and fracture in patients with  SLE compared with general population and although there is a high prevalence of  vitamin D insufficiency in the general population, previous studies had  demonstrated lower vitamin D levels in patients with SLE compared to age-matched  controls. The etiology of reduced bone mass and reduced vitamin D plasma levels  in SLE is multifactorial and includes a variety of intrinsic factors related to  the disease itself and treatment side effects. SLE patients are at risk for  developing these two comorbidities (reduced vitamin D plasma levels and low BMD)  and it is therefore essential to study, monitor, prevent and treat bone  metabolism disorders in SLE patients.

T1  - Favorable effects of hydroxychloroquine on serum low density lipid in patients 
SP  - 84-92
AB  - AIMS: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has shown to have significant immunomodulatory  effects in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Current studies  show favorable effects of HCQ on traditional cardiac risk factors in patients  with SLE. This review examined the effects of HCQ on serum low-density  lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with SLE. METHODS: A systematic search of  seven major literature search databases from their inception until 3 April, 2017  identified nine studies. Random-effects pooled mean difference with corresponding  95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Heterogeneity was measured by I(2)  . Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots. Sensitivity  analysis examined whether HCQ effect on serum total cholesterol level was similar  to the main analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and  Evaluation system was used to assess the overall quality of evidence. RESULTS:  Pooled study participants were 559 patients from eight observation studies (two  before-after studies; six case-control studies) examining the effects of HCQ on  serum LDL. Pooled study participants' characteristics were as follows: mean age  45.719, female 95.262%, and prednisone use 58.366%. HCQ reduced mean LDL levels  by 24.397 mg/dL (95% CI 8.921-39.872; P = 0.002). The number of studies  identifying statin use was too few to perform meta-regression analysis of statin  use. Heterogeneity was extensive (I(2) = 94.739%). Symmetrical funnel plot  visualized no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: HCQ was associated with  serum LDL level reduction by mean 24.397 mg/dL in patients with SLE. Future  prospective studies are need to fully characterize the treatment effect.

T1  - The complement system as a potential therapeutic target in rheumatic disease.
SP  - 538-547
AB  - Complement activation is associated with common rheumatic diseases such as  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic  vasculitis. Evidence linking complement activation to these diseases includes the  presence of complement deposition in affected tissues, decreased levels of  complement proteins and high levels of complement activation fragments in the  blood and/or synovial fluid of patients with these diseases, as well as data from  experimental models. Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the  complement component C5, is now approved for the treatment of rare conditions  involving complement hyperactivation, and the success of this therapy has renewed  interest in understanding the utility of complement inhibition in rheumatological  practice, particularly for SLE. For example, inhibiting C5 is a potential means  of reducing glomerular inflammation in lupus nephritis or treating thrombotic  microangiopathy in SLE. The complement system is one of multiple mediators of  tissue injury in complex diseases such as SLE, and identifying the disease  context in which complement activation has a predominant role is a challenge. An  added difficulty in RA is identifying a role for therapeutic complement  inhibition within the diverse treatment modalities already available. In this  Review, evidence for the therapeutic potential of complement manipulation in  rheumatology practice is evaluated.

T1  - Lupus Nephritis and Pregnancy: Concerns and Management.
SP  - 347-353
AB  - Pregnancy associated with lupus, especially lupus nephritis, is often fraught  with concern for both the mother and fetus. Thus, it is paramount that care  begins preconception so that proper planning in terms of optimizing the medical  regimen, discontinuation of fetotoxic agents, and treatment of active disease can  occur. It is well known that active nephritis at the time of conception is  associated with poor outcomes. Even with quiescent disease, recent data indicate  that being lupus anticoagulant-positive, nonwhite or Hispanic, and using  antihypertensive medications were all predictors of worse pregnancy outcomes.  Further, prior lupus nephritis also predicts higher rates of preeclampsia and  HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome.  Differentiating lupus nephritis from preeclampsia often presents as a conundrum,  but lupus nephritis can be confirmed by the presence of decreasing complement  levels and increasing double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody levels in addition to  new onset hypertension and proteinuria. We hope that the more mechanistic  approach of measuring angiogenic markers, which are diagnostic for preeclampsia,  will be the standard of care in the future. Women with lupus and prior lupus  nephritis can have successful pregnancies, but outcomes are dependent on "the art  of planning" as well as close communication between the obstetrician, the  nephrologist, and the rheumatologist.

T1  - Developing and Refining New Candidate Criteria for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
SP  - 571-581
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define candidate criteria within multiphase development of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) classification criteria, jointly supported by the  American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism.  Prior steps included item generation and reduction by Delphi exercise, further  narrowed to 21 items in a nominal group technique exercise. Our objectives were  to apply an evidence-based approach to the 21 candidate criteria, and to develop  hierarchical organization of criteria within domains. METHODS: A literature  review identified the sensitivity and specificity of the 21 candidate criteria.  Data on the performance of antinuclear antibody (ANA) as an entry criterion and  operating characteristics of the candidate criteria in early SLE patients were  evaluated. Candidate criteria were hierarchically organized into clinical and  immunologic domains, and definitions were refined in an iterative process.  RESULTS: Based on the data, consensus was reached to use a positive ANA of >/=1:80  titer (HEp-2 cells immunofluorescence) as an entry criterion and to have 7  clinical and 3 immunologic domains, with hierarchical organization of criteria  within domains. Definitions of the candidate criteria were specified. CONCLUSION:  Using a data-driven process, consensus was reached on new, refined criteria  definitions and organization based on operating characteristics. This work will  be followed by a multicriteria decision analysis exercise to weight criteria and  to identify a threshold score for classification on a continuous probability  scale.

T1  - Additional Improvements in Clinical Response From Adjuvant Biologic Response 
SP  - 1479-1506.e45
AB  - PURPOSE: The role of biologic disease-modifying drugs in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains controversial. METHODS: Following systematic  review and meta-analysis protocol, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library,  and ClinicalTrials.gov in January 2017 to identify all studies of people with SLE  treated with biologic response modifiers. We performed direct frequentist random  effects meta-analyses, calculated pooled relative risk and number needed to treat  to achieve an outcome in 1 patient (NNT) as reciprocal to statistically  significant absolute risk difference, and graded the quality of evidence by using  the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria.  FINDINGS: Seven meta-analyses, 33 publications of randomized controlled trials  (RCTs), and 5 observational studies met inclusion criteria. All studies enrolled  previously treated adults with moderate to severe SLE despite conventional  immunosuppression. In patients with extrarenal SLE, adjunctive belimumab (10  mg/kg) increases the rates of clinical response (moderate quality evidence from 2  RCTs, 1125 patients, NNT = 8 [95% CI, 6-16]), whereas adjunctive rituximab or  abatacept are ineffective. In adults with lupus nephritis, adjunctive rituximab  (4000 mg, very-low-quality evidence from 1 RCT, 144 patients, NNT = 5 [95% CI,  3-18]), but not abatacept, improves renal function. Belimumab and rituximab do  not increase the risk of serious intolerable adverse effects leading to treatment  discontinuation. Rigerimod, blisibimod, sifalimumab, and anifrolumab show  promising results in early RCTs, whereas epratuzumab and tabalumab have an  unfavorable benefit-to-harm balance. IMPLICATIONS: In adults with moderate to  severe SLE despite conventional immunosuppressive agents, adjunctive belimumab in  extrarenal SLE and off-label rituximab in lupus nephritis may offer additional  modest benefits.

T1  - Clinical and Economic Evaluation of Repository Corticotropin Injection: A 
SP  - 1775-1790
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Repository corticotropin injection (RCI; H.P. Acthar((R)) Gel;  Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals Inc., Hampton, NJ) is a highly purified,  prolonged-release porcine preparation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  analogue that is FDA-approved for treatment of 19 autoimmune and inflammatory  disorders. The diverse physiological actions of RCI at the melanocortin receptors  (MCRs) affect processes involved in inflammation, pigmentation, steroidogenesis,  and immunomodulation. Although RCI has been approved to treat inflammatory and  autoimmune diseases for more than 60 years, recent progress in understanding both  MCRs and the effects of RCI in modulating immune responses has led to increased  interest in RCI as a therapeutic choice. The objective of this narrative  literature review is to summarize key clinical and economic data on RCI treatment  of seven disorders: infantile spasms (IS), multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses,  proteinuria in nephrotic syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA),  dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and  symptomatic sarcoidosis based on published literature and product information. An  extended report is available as the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP)  Formulary dossier for H.P. Acthar((R)) Gel. METHODS: Key studies of clinical  efficacy and healthcare utilization and cost from 1956 to 2016 are summarized.  RESULTS: The evidence supports the efficacy of RCI across the seven indications.  RCI is effective as a first-line therapy for IS. For the other six conditions,  RCI may improve clinical outcomes during exacerbations or when the condition is  resistant to conventional treatments. Use of RCI is associated with reduced use  of biologics, corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  Initiation of RCI therapy in patients with IS, MS, RA, SLE, or DM/PM has been  associated with lower post-therapy healthcare utilization and medical costs,  including decreases in hospitalizations, hospital length of stay, outpatient  visits, and emergency department visits. CONCLUSION: The evidence suggests that  RCI may improve inflammatory and autoimmune disease control and patient quality  of life, particularly in complex patients, and yield healthcare cost savings that  demonstrate the medicine's value.

T1  - Current status of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 167-178
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic disease of unknown aetiology  with variable course and prognosis. Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the important  disease manifestations of SLE with considerable influence on patient outcomes.  Immunosuppression therapy has made it possible to control the disease with  improved life expectancy and quality of life. In the last few decades, various  studies across the globe have clarified the role, dose and duration of  immunosuppression currently in use and also provided evidence for new agents such  as mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors and rituximab. However, there is  still a need to develop new and specific therapy with less adverse effects. In  this review, the current evidence of the treatment of LN and its evolution, and  new classification criteria for SLE have been discussed. Also, rationale for  low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction agent followed by azathioprine  as maintenance agent has been provided with emphasis on individualized and  holistic approach.

SP  - 118-123
AB  - In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), lupus nephritis (LN) is an important  complication as an intractable condition and considered to be a prognostic  factor. Based on the past reports that explain immunological functions of OPN and  its relationship with autoimmune diseases such as LN or IgA nephropathy, we  measured OPN full and OPN N-half in serum and urine of SLE patients and examined  the possibility as a disease biomarker. OPN N-half is known as a more  physiologically active form than OPN full. As a result, OPN N-half in urine was  higher in LN than in healthy control, and also higher than in diabetic  nephropathy that is a non-inflammatory nephropathy. In addition, OPN N-half in  urine decreased after the treatment of LN, suggesting that OPN N-half in urine  could be a biomarker for evaluating disease activity of LN.

T1  - Efficacy and Safety of Rituximab in the Management of Pediatric Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 213-219.e2
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab for treating  pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE). STUDY DESIGN: We performed a  systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in children  with pSLE. Data from studies performed before July 2016 were collected from  MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and the International Rheumatic Disease  Abstracts, with no language restrictions. Study eligibility criteria included  clinical trials and observational studies with a minimal sample size of 5  patients, regarding treatment with rituximab in patients with refractory pSLE  (aged <18 years at the time of diagnosis). Independent extraction of articles was  performed by 2 investigators using predefined data fields. RESULTS: Twelve case  series met the criteria for data extraction for the systematic review with a good  quality assessment according to an 18-criteria checklist using a modified Delphi  method. Among them, 3 studies were multicenter and 3 were prospective. The total  number of patients was 272. Studies collected patients with active disease  refractory to steroids and immunosuppressant drugs. Refractory lupus nephritis  was the most common indication (33%). Acceptable evidence suggested improvements  in renal, neuropsychiatric and haematological manifestations, disease activity,  complement and anti-double stranded Desoxy-Nucleo-Adenosine, with a  steroid-sparing effect. However, there was poor evidence suggesting efficacy on  arthralgia, photosensitivity, and mucocutaneous manifestations of SLE in  children. An overall acceptable safety profile with few major adverse events was  shown. CONCLUSION: Rituximab exhibited a satisfactory profile regarding efficacy  and safety indicating that this agent is a promising therapy for pSLE and should  be further investigated.

T1  - Predictive and prognostic factors influencing outcomes of rituximab therapy in 
SP  - 384-396
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes following rituximab (RTX) treatment in patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is highly variable. We aimed to identify  predictive and prognostic factors associated with RTX therapy outcomes in  patients with SLE. METHODS: Studies in adults and paediatric patients with SLE  were included. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for predictors of  differential treatment effect and cohort studies for potential prognostic factors  in patients treated with RTX (global clinical, cutaneous and renal either  response or relapse, and side effects). Methodological quality was assessed using  Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool and the Quality In Prognosis Studies  Tool (QUIPS) for RCTs and cohort studies, respectively. The quality of subgroup  analyses testing predictors of differential treatment response was also  evaluated. A best evidence synthesis was performed using the Grading of  Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework.  RESULTS: Sixteen articles were included (3 from 2 RCTs and 13 from 6 cohort  studies). The overall quality of evidence (QoE) was low to very low (GRADE  framework). QoE for predictive factors based on RCTs analysing sociodemographic  variables, was rated very low due to the lack of interaction tests, limited power  of subgroup analyses, study limitations, and imprecisions. Disease-related  factors including clinical phenotype and severity, baseline anti-ENA antibodies  and anti-Ro antibodies, interleukin (IL) 2/21 single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP), as well as post-RTX complete B-cell depletion and earlier B-cell  repopulation showed some evidence for prognostic value, but were rated low to  very low QoE because of early phase of investigation (exploratory analysis),  insufficient adjustment for confounding in most studies, high risk of bias,  inconsistency, and imprecisions. CONCLUSIONS: To date, studies addressing  prognostic factors are hypothesis generating and cannot be used to make any  specific recommendations for routine clinical practice. A number of potential  predictors/prognostic factors were identified, which require to be validated as  being specific for response to RTX therapy and to enable more personalised use of  this agent.

SP  - 523-525
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a diverse and heterogeneous disease with  much variation between different ethnicities. Although more severe and prevalent  in non-Caucasian populations, the bulk of evidence regarding 'Asian lupus' had  traditionally been extrapolated from studies on patient minorities in the West.  Lupus research in Asia has since grown exponentially and now takes a leading role  in improving the care for SLE patients worldwide. With recent advances,  particularly from studies in population-specific phenotyping, genome-wide  association studies, lupus nephritis and innovative treatment modalities, we now  have an expanding understanding of both the basic science and clinical management  of SLE. Upcoming breakthroughs from growing multi-ethnic cohorts and  international collaborations will likely bring further important ramifications  for SLE management in the near future.

T1  - Performance of Antinuclear Antibodies for Classifying Systemic Lupus 
SP  - 428-438
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on the performance of indirect  immunofluorescence (IIF)-HEp-2 antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing for  classification of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A systematic  literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases  for articles published between January 1990 and October 2015. The research  question was structured according to Population, Intervention, Comparator,  Outcome (PICO) format rules, and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews  and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations were followed where appropriate.  Meta-regression analysis for diagnostic tests was performed, using the ANA titer  as independent variable, while sensitivity and specificity were dependent  variables. RESULTS: Of 4,483 publications screened, 62 matched the eligibility  criteria, and another 2 articles were identified through reference analysis. The  included studies comprised 13,080 SLE patients in total, of whom 12,542 (95.9%)  were reported to be IIF-ANA positive at various titers. For ANA at titers of  1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:320, meta-regression gave sensitivity values of 98.4%  (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 97.6-99.0%), 97.8% (95% CI 96.8-98.5%), 95.8%  (95% CI 94.1-97.1%), and 86.0% (95% CI 77.0-91.9%), respectively. The  corresponding specificities were 66.9% (95% CI 57.8-74.9%), 74.7% (95% CI  66.7-81.3%), 86.2% (95% CI 80.4-90.5%), and 96.6% (95% CI 93.9-98.1%),  respectively. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic literature review and  meta-regression confirm that IIF-ANAs have high sensitivity for SLE. ANAs at a  titer of 1:80 have sufficiently high sensitivity to be considered as an entry  criterion for SLE classification criteria, i.e., formally test other  classification criteria for SLE only if ANAs of at least 1:80 have been found.

T1  - Gastrointestinal system involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1127-1138
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disorder which can affect the  gastrointestinal (GI) system. Although GI symptoms can manifest in 50% of  patients with SLE, these have barely been reviewed due to difficulty in  identifying different causes. This study aims to clarify clinical  characteristics, diagnosis and treatment of the four major SLE-related GI system  complications: protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), intestinal pseudo-obstruction  (IPO), hepatic involvement and pancreatitis. It is a systematic review using  MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the major search terms were SLE, PLE, IPO,  hepatitis and pancreatitis. A total of 125 articles were chosen for our study.  SLE-related PLE was characterized by edema and hypoalbuminemia, with Technetium  99m labeled human albumin scintigraphy ((99m)Tc HAS) and alpha-1-antitrypsin  fecal clearance test commonly used as diagnostic test. The most common site of  protein leakage was the small intestine and the least common site was the  stomach. More than half of SLE-related IPO patients had ureterohydronephrosis,  and sometimes they manifested as interstitial cystitis and hepatobiliary  dilatation. Lupus hepatitis and SLE accompanied by autoimmune hepatitis (SLE-AIH  overlap) shared similar clinical manifestations but had different autoantibodies  and histopathological features, and positive anti-ribosome P antibody highly  indicated the diagnosis of lupus hepatitis. Lupus pancreatitis was usually  accompanied by high SLE activity with a relatively high mortality rate. Early  diagnosis and timely intervention were crucial, and administration of  corticosteroids and immunosuppressants was effective for most of the patients.

T1  - Pregnancy and Glomerular Disease: A Systematic Review of the Literature with 
SP  - 1862-1872
AB  - During pregnancy, CKD increases both maternal and fetal risk. Adverse maternal  outcomes include progression of underlying renal dysfunction, worsening of urine  protein, and hypertension, whereas adverse fetal outcomes include fetal loss,  intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm delivery. As such, pregnancy in  young women with CKD is anxiety provoking for both the patient and the clinician  providing care, and because the heterogeneous group of glomerular diseases often  affects young women, this is an area of heightened concern. In this invited  review, we discuss pregnancy outcomes in young women with glomerular diseases. We  have performed a systematic review in attempt to better understand these outcomes  among young women with primary GN, we review the studies of pregnancy outcomes in  lupus nephritis, and finally, we provide a potential construct for management.  Although it is safe to say that the vast majority of young women with glomerular  disease will have a live birth, the counseling that we can provide with respect  to individualized risk remains imprecise in primary GN because the existing  literature is extremely dated, and all management principles are extrapolated  primarily from studies in lupus nephritis and diabetes. As such, the study of  pregnancy outcomes and management strategies in these rare diseases requires a  renewed interest and a dedicated collaborative effort.

T1  - Treatment for lupus nephritis: an overview of systematic reviews and 
SP  - 1089-1099
AB  - The aim is to systematically review the treatment for lupus nephritis (LN) by  performing an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Electronic  databases of OVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched to  identify published systematic reviews and meta-analyses investigating treatments  for LN up to 13 July 2016. A measurement tool to assess systematic reviews  (AMSTAR) was used to assess the quality of included studies. Totally, 24 studies  were included. Of the eligible studies, 3 studies were rated as poor quality, 11  as moderate, and 10 as good. In LN induction therapy, comparing to  cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus had higher complete remission rate, response rate,  and anti-dsDNA negative conversion rate and led to lower risks of  gastrointestinal symptoms and amenorrhea, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was  associated with higher response rate and less adverse events of leucopenia,  alopecia, and ovarian failure. However, there was no difference in the efficacy  and adverse events between tacrolimus and MMF. In LN maintenance therapy, the  relapse rate and leucopenia rate were lower in MMF group than in azathioprine  group, but there were no differences of end-stage kidney disease rate and  mortality rate between the two groups. For LN induction therapy, both Tacrolimus  and MMF are more effective and safer than cyclophosphamide, while there are no  differences of efficacy or safety between the two treatments. For LN maintenance  therapy, MMF seems to have less adverse events and lower relapse rate than  azathioprine.

SP  - 1502-1512
AB  - Objective Before using a test, it should be determined whether the results are  reliable. The reliability of the interpretation of renal biopsy in patients with  lupus nephritis has not been clearly elucidated. Our objective was to estimate  inter and intra-observer reliability of the histological classification, as well  as activity and chronicity indices in renal biopsy of patients with lupus  nephritis. Methods We conducted a systematic search of the literature, which  included articles in any language, using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Lilacs  databases. Search terms included were: reproducibility, reliability, agreement,  systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis. Comparative studies with any  design were included, regardless of the year or the language of publication. Two  investigators, independently, screened the literature published in accordance  with pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results We found 13  relevant studies. Inter-observer reproducibility of most measurements was  moderate or low, despite the fact that, in most cases, the readings were made by  expert nephropathologists. There was great diversity among designs, participants,  including samples and outcomes evaluated in different studies. Although there are  too many reports on the clinical use, studies evaluating the reliability of  classifications on renal biopsy in lupus nephritis are rare. The quality of the  methodological design and reporting was fair. Conclusion The interpretation of  renal biopsy in lupus nephritis is poorly reproducible, causing serious doubts  about its validity and its clinical application. As it can lead to serious  diagnosis, treatment and prognosis errors, it is necessary to intensify research  in this field.

T1  - The Effectiveness of Exercise in Adults With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: A 
SP  - 306-315
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most common and unpleasant symptom of patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, there is limited information  regarding how exercise affects fatigue. AIMS: The purpose of this study is to  review and synthesize the current knowledge concerning the effectiveness of  exercise training for treating fatigue among adults with SLE. The characteristics  of beneficial exercise training are further evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a  systematic review and meta-analysis. The databases searched were MEDLINE, CINAHL,  PEDro, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and PQDT from their inception to February 3,  2016. The quality of each selected study was assessed using the PEDro scale. A  between-group analysis was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the  exercise training. Data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan  5.3 (Copenhagen, Denmark). RESULTS: Two randomized controlled trials and one  quasiexperimental study were included in this systematic review and  meta-analysis. Aerobic exercise, three times a week and of moderate intensity,  was a common component of the three studies. Two studies were conducted in a  supervised setting and one study was based at home. One study lasted 8 weeks and  two studies lasted 12 weeks. The meta-analysis showed that aerobic exercise could  decrease fatigue (MD = -.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-.91, -.13], p = .009)  and increase vitality (MD = 14.98, 95% CI [7.45, 22.52], p < .001). The subgroup  analysis indicated that 12 weeks of exercise training and exercise under a  supervised setting significantly benefited fatigue. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION:  The pooled data indicate that 12 weeks of an aerobic exercise program that is  supervised by health professionals could reduce fatigue and increase vitality for  patients with SLE. SLE patients with mild disease should begin with moderate  intensity for at least 20 minutes, 3 days a week.

T1  - Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage in Autoimmune Diseases.
SP  - 27
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The present paper establishes a narrative and analytical  review of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in ANCA-associated vasculitis,  systemic lupus erythematosus, and antiphospholipid syndrome. RECENT FINDINGS:  Recent studies found a frequent association between DAH and infections and  systemic lupus erythematosus and its associated factors. Biological therapies  like rituximab have demonstrated benefit mainly in patients with ANCA-associated  vasculitis. Main clinical manifestations of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in these  three diseases include dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, cough, and hypoxemia. The  presence of hemorrhagic bronchoalveolar lavage, hemosiderin containing  macrophages, or an increase of carbon monoxide diffusing capacity have been  described in some series as helpful findings for the diagnosis. Hemoptysis has  been seen mainly in systemic lupus erythematosus. The cornerstone of therapy  includes glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, and recent findings in  ANCA-associated vasculitis suggest the similar benefit of rituximab. Future  evaluations and systematic reviews will help to define the real benefit for  therapies that appeared to be controversial at the moment.

T1  - Biologic Therapies for Autoimmune and Connective Tissue Diseases.
SP  - 283-299
AB  - Biologic therapy continues to revolutionize the treatment of autoimmune disease,  especially in rheumatology as the pathophysiology of both inflammation and  autoimmune disease becomes better understood. These therapies are designed to  dampen the response of the inflammatory cascades. Although the first biologic  therapies were approved many years ago, expanding indications and new agents  continue to challenge the traditional treatment strategies for rheumatic  diseases. This article reviews the data supporting the current use of biologic  therapies, including off-label indications, in a subset of rheumatic diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory myositis, ankylosing  spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, vasculitis, and gout.

SP  - 65-78
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to summarize the evidence examining factors that predict  differential response to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: Systematic searches of randomized clinical trials  (RCT) to identify predictors of the effects of MMF (moderators), and cohort  studies to explore prognostic factors associated with MMF outcomes (response,  relapse, or adverse events) were performed. Two reviewers independently assessed  the methodological quality of RCTs using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias  tool and cohort studies using the QUality In Prognosis Studies tool. The quality  of subgroup analysis, providing evidence for moderation, was evaluated. The  Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation working group  approach summarized the quality of evidence (QoE), considering the risk of bias,  imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. RESULTS: From 26  studies (13 from 7 RCTs and 13 cohort studies) we found low QoE evidence for  Black/Hispanic race/ethnicity predicting better renal responses to MMF in lupus  nephritis (LN) from one RCT. There was low QoE evidence from cohort studies that  a higher baseline creatinine and membranous features on renal biopsy were  associated with poorer responses in LN. There was very low QoE for other  moderators or prognostic factors associated with MMF treatment outcomes. QoE from  RCTs was affected by exploratory or insufficient evidence from subgroup analysis  and in both study types high risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision also  affected QoE. CONCLUSIONS: In SLE, evidence for predictors of response to MMF is  limited and none can be recommended for use in routine clinical practice.  Specific studies of predictors measured at baseline and during treatment are  needed with a priori hypotheses based on preliminary evidence to date and with  sufficient power to determine which factors can be employed in clinical decision  making.

T1  - Treatment of pediatric-onset lupus nephritis: a proposal of optimal therapy.
SP  - 755-763
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the major clinical manifestations of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) which occurs frequently in the early stages of  pediatric-onset cases. Since SLE is a chronic disease associated with frequent  disease flares and effective and safe maintenance therapy is required for  achieving a favorable outcome, optimal treatment for LN in pubertal patients is a  great challenge that remains to be overcome. Although its etiology remains  unclear, it has been reported that the innate and adaptive immune systems have  been reported to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE. However,  studies of drugs that have been useful in controlling inflammatory pathways  mediated by the innate and adaptive immune systems are now underway. In clinical  practice, recent advances in the management of LN, together with earlier renal  biopsy and selective use of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, have  contributed to a favorable outcome in children and adolescents with LN. However,  the balance of the efficacy of treatment in terms of long-term prognosis and its  adverse effects should be weighed in determining the treatment strategy.

T1  - Impact of systemic lupus erythematosus on maternal and fetal outcomes following 
SP  - 17-27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has already shown systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) to have severe consequences on pregnancy outcomes. However, insufficient  number of participants, which were mainly limited to one particular region,  limited outcomes analyzed and lack of evidence based analysis to support  systematic reviews of the literature were the limitations observed. Therefore, by  improving these limitations, we aimed to systematically show the impact of SLE on  maternal and fetal outcomes following pregnancy. METHODS: The Cochrane Database  of Randomized Controlled Trials, EMBASE and Medline databases were carefully  searched for appropriately relevant English language studies comparing maternal  and/or fetal outcomes (endpoints) in pregnant women with and without SLE. With  the presence of discontinuous data, risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals  (CI) were calculated and the final analysis was carried out by RevMan 5.3  software. RESULTS: Eleven studies with a total number of 529,778 participants  were included. This current analysis showed cesarean operation to be  significantly higher in patients with SLE (RR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.63-2.10;  P = 0.00001). Pre-eclampsia and hypertension also significantly affected women  with SLE, (RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.44-2.53; P = 0.00001) and (RR: 1.99, 95% CI:  1.54-2.56; P = 0.00001) respectively. In addition, spontaneous abortion,  thromboembolic disease, and post-partum infection were also significantly higher  in the SLE subgroup (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.26-1.82; P = 0.0001), (RR: 11.29, 95%  CI: 6.05-21.07; P = 0.00001) and (RR: 4.35, 95% CI: 2.69-7.03; P = 0.00001)  respectively. Live birth significantly favored infants who were born from mothers  without SLE (RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.14-1.67; P = 0.001). Significantly higher  premature birth and infants classified as 'small for gestational age' were  associated with SLE, (RR: 3.05, 95% CI: 2.56-3.63; P = 0.00001) and (RR: 1.69,  95% CI: 1.53-1.88; P = 0.00001) respectively. In addition, SLE was significantly  associated with increased number of infants that required neonatal intensive care  unit and infants with congenital defects (RR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.27-3.35;  P = 0.00001) and (RR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.93-3.58; P = 0.00001) respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis has shown SLE to indeed have a high impact on  maternal and fetal outcomes following pregnancy. Therefore, special treatments  and care should be allocated to those women in order to manage adverse outcomes  that might follow, and to improve successful normal delivery, term infants and to  reduce congenital abnormalities in infants who were born from mothers with SLE.

T1  - Amicrobial pustulosis of the folds: Where have we gone 25years after its original 
SP  - 169-175
AB  - BACKGROUND: Twenty-five years ago at the Journees Dermatologiques de Paris, Prof.  Beatrice Crickx described a new association, "antimicrobial pustulosis and  systemic lupus erythematosus", a condition now known as amicrobial pustulosis of  the folds (APF). The aim of this study is to analyse the clinical and laboratory  characteristics of APF and to outline the gradual advancement of knowledge  regarding this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on a case of APF seen in our  department, we carried out a review of the literature since 1991 by searching the  Medline database for scientific articles using the following keywords:  "Amicrobial Pustulosis" or "Pustular Dermatosis" and "Folds". RESULTS: We  collated 63 cases of APF. In total, 90% involved women and the mean age was 30  years. Cutaneous lesions consisted of pustules in an erythematous setting,  frequently erosive and affecting the skinfolds, anogenital region, scalp,  external auditory meatus and umbilicus. Histological examination revealed  spongiform subcorneal pustulosis associated with mixed inflammatory infiltrate in  the dermis. DISCUSSION: APF belongs to the spectrum of neutrophilic dermatoses.  Its complex physiopathology involves an auto-inflammatory mechanism. It is  associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases, in most cases systemic lupus  erythematosus. Diagnosis of the condition is difficult and is based on  histological correlation and negative microbiological culture. The most effective  treatment is still systemic corticosteroids, although new therapeutic  alternatives are emerging such as anakinra and anti-TNF-alpha drugs.

T1  - Toxic epidermal necrolysis in a child with lupus-associated pancreatitis.
SP  - 1221-1226
AB  - Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are  life-threatening dermatological conditions that are characterized by mucosal  erosions, epidermal detachments and erosions. The most common causes of SJS and  TEN are drugs; other causes such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  vaccinations and infections have been rarely implicated. We present the case of a  14-year-old female patient with acute pancreatitis as an initial manifestation of  systemic lupus erythematosus, complicated by the toxic epidermal necrolysis with  a fatal outcome. She initially presented with abdominal pain, fever, vomiting,  and intolerance to oral intake and elevated pancreatic enzyme levels. Systemic  lupus erythematosus was diagnosed secondary when her condition has been already  complicated by the toxic epidermal necrolysis. The administration of  corticosteroids and high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin did not lead to  positive effects in the treatment of our patient.

T1  - Smoking and pre-existing organ damage reduce the efficacy of belimumab in 
SP  - 343-351
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Belimumab is the first biologic drug approved for Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus (SLE). Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of belimumab on  clinical and serologic outcomes, and sought to identify predictors of treatment  response in three Swedish real-life settings. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were  enrolled at initiation of belimumab and followed longitudinally for up to  53months. Surveillance outcomes included the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000  (SLEDAI-2K), 100mm Visual Analogue Scales for Physician's Global Assessment  (PGA), fatigue, pain and general health, and the Systemic Lupus International  Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index (SDI).  Assessment of treatment response included the SLE responder index (SRI). B  lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) levels were determined using ELISA. RESULTS:  SLEDAI-2K (median baseline score: 8.0; IQR: 4.0-13.8), PGA and corticosteroid use  decreased during therapy, and patients reported improvements on fatigue, pain,  and general health (p<0.0001 for all). SDI scores remained stable (p=0.08).  Patients with baseline SDI scores >1 showed decreased probability and prolonged  time to attain SRI response (HR: 0.449; 95% CI: 0.208-0.967), as did current  smokers compared with non-smokers (HR: 0.103; 95% CI: 0.025-0.427). In contrast,  baseline BLyS levels >/=1.2ng/mL predicted increased probability and shorter time  to attain SRI response (HR: 2.566; 95% CI: 1.222-5.387). CONCLUSIONS: Disease  activity and corticosteroid usage decreased, patient-reported outcomes improved,  and no significant organ damage was accrued during follow-up. Smoking and organ  damage predicted reduced treatment efficacy. These findings might contribute to a  better selection of patients who are likely to benefit from belimumab.

T1  - Organ-specific biomarkers in lupus.
SP  - 391-397
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex and highly heterogeneous disease,  which affects multiple organs, including joints, skin, kidneys, heart,  hematopoietic system, and nerve system. While the etiopathogenesis of SLE still  remains unclear, genetic susceptibilities and aberrant epigenetic modifications  are believed to be involved. For precision therapy, it is necessary to assess  accurately and objectively organ involvements and disease activity, which is  difficult by current clinical laboratory tests. Biomarkers, which are a biologic,  genetic, epigenetic or a chemical characteristic and conveniently detectable,  serve as measures of disease diagnosis, activity, prognosis, and manifestation  prediction, thereby providing instruction for individualized therapy. In  addition, biomarkers differ according to different manifestations, since the  disease activity index and treatments vary significantly. For example, unlike  other non-renal SLE, lupus nephritis requires significant immunosuppressive  drugs. Over the past decades, the research on biomarkers in lupus has been  strengthened and numerous promising biomarkers have been identified at levels of  genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics. In this review, we summarize the  conventional and novel biomarkers in the tissue-specific manner, and discuss  their roles in specific organ diagnosis, future manifestation prediction, disease  activity assessment and their correlation with histology results. By doing so, it  aims to shed a light on individualized treatment.

T1  - Inhibition of B cell activating factor (BAFF) in the management of systemic lupus 
SP  - 623-633
AB  - The anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody, belimumab, was approved 5+ years ago by the US  Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult SLE patients. Although  BAFF is now a proven therapeutic target in SLE, the limited clinical efficacy  both in the clinical trials setting and in 'real-life' experience begs for  further therapeutic improvement. Areas covered: In addition to belimumab, three  other BAFF antagonists (atacicept, blisibimod, tabalumab) that biologically  differ from belimumab are being or have been evaluated in SLE late-stage clinical  trials. Literature search was performed using the search words/phrases, 'BAFF',  'BLyS', 'APRIL', 'BCMA', 'TACI', 'BR3', 'belimumab', 'atacicept', 'blisibimod',  'tabalumab', 'lupus clinical trial' along with papers from the author's personal  library. Expert commentary: The reasons underlying current lack of enthusiasm  among clinicians for BAFF antagonism are discussed, and speculation if offered  regarding the use of a BAFF antagonist as part of sequential therapy and  regarding the utility of individual or pairs of BAFF receptors as therapeutic  targets.

T1  - Pregnancy and menopause in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and/or 
SP  - 115-121
AB  - Over the last few decades, reproductive medicine has observed an improvement in  the management and outcome of pregnancy in connective tissue diseases, such as  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However,  pregnancy and related issues remain a challenge in these patients. In routine  clinical practice, health professionals dealing with SLE and APS need to consider  the numerous aspects of the reproductive life of their patients, such as  pregnancy, family planning, fertility, contraception, cancer surveillance, and  menopause. The new European League Against Rheumatism recommendations for women's  health and family planning reflect the need for a novel approach to communication  in the patient-physician relationship. Preconception counseling is essential to  ensure optimal pregnancy outcomes through a careful risk stratification involving  disease activity, organ involvement, autoantibody profile, use of drugs, and  previous pregnancy outcomes, as well as to ensure better preventive and  therapeutic strategies to limit complications. In patients with stable/inactive  disease and low risk of thrombosis, adequate hormonal contraception and  menopausal replacement therapy should be recommended. Assisted reproductive  techniques can be safely used in these patients, but anticoagulation or low-dose  aspirin (or both) should be added in those with positive antiphospholipid  antibody titers. All menstruating women should be counseled on the possibility to  preserve fertility with gonadotropin- ‑releasing hormone analogues if receiving  alkylating agents. Strict clinical, serological, laboratory, and  multidisciplinary monitoring during pregnancy is mandatory to early recognize and  effectively treat disease flares or obstetric complications. Doppler  ultrasonography and fetal biometry should be regularly performed, especially in  the second and third trimesters. Physicians should recommend screening for  cervical dysplasia related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, especially  during immunosuppressive therapy, and HPV immunization can be used in women with  stable/inactive disease.

T1  - Aminoleveulinate photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) for Bowen's disease in a SLE 
SP  - 20-23
AB  - We reported a rare case of topical 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-photodynamic  therapy (PDT) in the treatment of a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient  with lower limb multiple Bowen's disease (BD). At the end of the treatment, an  excellent clinical response was observed and no recurrence of rash after 2 months  of treatment. The recovery time was prolonged only after the first treatment,  however, no photosensitive phenomena were observed during and after the  treatment. This is the first report to describe ALA-PDT for patient-confirmed  photosensitivity in an Asian patient. Whether PDT is contraindicated for SLE  remains to be discussed, although our findings show that PDT can be used as an  alternative therapy for SLE patients with BD who cannot tolerate surgery.

T1  - [Tapering and termination of immunosuppressive therapy : Systemic lupus 
SP  - 27-32
AB  - Similar to patients with other rheumatic diseases, patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) nowadays can also have the desire to terminate  immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory medications. In order to provide  appropriate advice to patients, the two main issues are the risk of severe  adverse events under long-term therapy with any drug and the perceived risk of  a flare, in particular of severe flares. The risks of long-term therapy vary  greatly between drugs, ranging from severe unacceptable risks with  cyclophosphamide and higher dose glucocorticoids to low risks usually outweighed  by long-term benefits with hydroxychloroquine. The individual risk of flares is  often difficult to estimate but clinical remission and at least 3 years of  immunosuppression are recommended for lupus nephritis. The duration of remission  can also be shorter in cases of milder forms of disease. This review article  tries to put the available evidence into a clinical perspective and to derive  concrete recommendations.

T1  - Sjogren Syndrome and Pregnancy: A Literature Review.
SP  - 16-047
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Autoimmune diseases do not impair fertility, and women with  autoimmune diseases who become pregnant are likely to experience more complicated  pregnancies than are women without the disease. Pregnancies complicated by these  disorders have a high clinical impact on both the pregnancy and the disease. The  effect of autoimmune disease on pregnancy differs according to the type of  maternal disease, disease activity, severity of organ damage, antibody profile,  and drug treatment. Sjogren syndrome is an autoimmune disease with a high  prevalence of anti-SS-A (anti-Ro) and anti-SS-B (anti-La) antibodies. Anti-SS-A  antibodies are associated with congenital heart block. Data on pregnancy outcomes  in primary Sjogren syndrome are scarce. METHODS: We performed a review of the  literature regarding pregnancy outcomes in women with Sjogren syndrome. RESULTS:  Women with Sjogren syndrome are likely to experience more complications during  pregnancy than women without an autoimmune disease. Studies show a high incidence  of poor fetal outcomes for these patients. CONCLUSION: Women with Sjogren  syndrome require prenatal counseling explaining the risks involved and the need  to control the disease well before conception. High-risk pregnancies can be  optimally managed by a multidisciplinary team.

T1  - Two cases demonstrating thalidomide's efficacy in refractory lupus nephritis.
SP  - 725-728
AB  - Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is common and has been  associated with an increased risk of mortality [1]. Early diagnosis is imperative  to control proteinuria and prevent the progression to end-stage renal disease.  Standard induction therapies include cyclophosphamide (CYC) and mycophenolate  mofetil (MMF); however, it has been estimated that approximately 30% of patients  are refractory to these standard treatments after 1 year [2]. We present two  cases of patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis (LN) who demonstrated persistent  proteinuria while on standard treatments that markedly improved after addition of  thalidomide (THD). A literature review was performed indicating that THD use with  prednisolone (PL) was more efficacious than MMF with PL in resolving lupus  nephritis in a mouse model. Thalidomide, which was well tolerated, was associated  with a reduction in the protein-to-creatinine ratio with sustained results in  both of our patient cases. These cases suggest more clinical data is needed to  explore the potential utility of thalidomide in the treatment of LN.

T1  - The role and diagnostic value of cell-free DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 330-336
AB  - Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) represents a small fraction of total DNA pool that  circulates freely in the blood both in normal and pathological conditions. Data  indicate that cfDNA plays an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and hypomethylation may be crucial for its immunogenic  properties. Although differences in quantification methodology hinder the  comparison of results between the studies, it appears that levels of cfDNA are  abnormally elevated in SLE patients and correlate with various antibody titers,  but not with disease activity. Increased cfDNA concentration, however, may be  associated with active lupus nephritis. Most of the studies confirmed apoptosis  as the major cfDNA release mechanism in various conditions, but formation of  neutrophil extracellular traps may significantly contribute to the cfDNA  generation in SLE patients. In this review, we summarise current knowledge about  the role and possible origin of cfDNA in SLE patients, and discuss why cfDNA  testing for diagnostic and prognosis of SLE remains questionable.

SP  - 1785-1788
AB  - Meanwhile, five years have passed since the approval of the anti-BAFF antibody  belimumab as a first biological for SLE, but no further SLE drug candidate is  even close to approval. There are still no clinical trial data available for the  use of new oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome. In spite of  convincing evidence for the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in lupus  nephritis, the German "Gemeinsame Bundesausschuss" (GBA) has not yet decided on  its reimbursement. However, several of the ongoing clinical trials have potential  to lead to important advances in SLE treatment in the future. At least, we have  validated tools for detecting therapeutic effects in SLE treatment trials. In  addition, there are large projects ongoing to develop defined treatment goals for  the management of SLE as well as new classification criteria, which hopefully  will be generally accepted.

T1  - Advances in the care of children with lupus nephritis.
SP  - 406-414
AB  - The care of children with lupus nephritis (LN) has changed dramatically over the  past 50 y. The majority of patients with childhood-onset systemic lupus  erythematosus (cSLE) develop LN. In the 1960's, prognosis in children was worse  than in adults; therapies were limited and toxic. Nearly half of cases resulted  in death within 2 y. Since this time, several diagnostic recommendations and  disease-specific indices have been developed to assist physicians caring for  patients with LN. Pediatric researchers are validating and adapting these indices  and guidelines for the treatment of LN in cSLE. Classification systems, activity,  and chronicity indices for kidney biopsy have been validated in pediatric cohorts  in several countries. Implementation of contemporary immunosuppressive agents has  reduced treatment toxicity and improved outcomes. Biomarkers sensitive to LN in  children have been identified in the kidney, urine, and blood.  Multi-institutional collaborative networks have formed to address the challenges  of pediatric LN research. Considerable variation in evaluation and treatment has  been addressed for proliferative forms of LN by development of consensus  treatment practices. Patient survival at 5 y is now 95-97% and renal survival  exceeds 90%. Moreover, international consensus exists for quality indicators for  cSLE that consider the unique aspects of chronic disease in childhood.

T1  - Improving B-cell depletion in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid 
SP  - 667-676
AB  - Rituximab-based B-cell depletion (BCD) therapy is effective in refractory  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and although used to treat patients with refractory  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in routine clinical practice, rituximab failed  to meet the primary endpoints in two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of  non-renal (EXPLORER) and renal (LUNAR) SLE. Areas covered: We review how BCD  could be improved to achieve better clinical responses in RA and SLE. Insights  into the variability in clinical response to BCD in RA and SLE may help develop  new therapeutic strategies. To this end, a literature search was performed using  the following terms: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic erythematosus lupus,  rituximab and B-cell depletion. Expert commentary: Poor trial design may have, at  least partly, contributed to the apparent lack of response to BCD in the two RCTs  of patients with SLE. Enhanced B-cell depletion and/or sequential therapy with  belimumab may improve clinical response at least in some patients with SLE.

SP  - 825-835
AB  - SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the kidneys in about 50% of  patients. Lupus nephritis is a major risk factor for overall morbidity and  mortality in SLE, and despite potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive  therapies still ends in CKD or ESRD for too many patients. This review highlights  recent updates in our understanding of disease epidemiology, genetics,  pathogenesis, and treatment in an effort to establish a framework for lupus  nephritis management that is patient-specific and oriented toward maintaining  long-term kidney function in patients with lupus.

T1  - [Management of systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 1052-1059
AB  - In the last few decades a number of small, often largely unrecognized steps have  fundamentally changed the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The  current goal is to stop all disease activity without long-term use of more than  5 mg prednisolone per day. Remission, i.e. absence of activity in the SLE  activity score of choice, is the defined target in the treat to target approach.  The essential basic measures include life-long hydroxychloroquine as well as  protection from sunlight (UV) and vitamin D substitution. Patients suffering from  SLE need more vaccinations than the healthy population and control of risk  factors for atherosclerosis is critical for long-term survival. Methotrexate is  on par with azathioprine. If disease activity cannot be controlled in this way,  belimumab is an approved therapeutic option. Cyclophosphamide is still used but  only in life-threatening situations, such as lupus nephritis or central nervous  system (CNS) vasculitis and in drastically reduced doses. Alternatively,  off-label mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can be used particularly for lupus  nephritis and off-label rituximab in refractory disease courses. Numerous novel  approaches are being tested in controlled trials and it is hoped that new drugs  will be available for SLE patients within a few years.

T1  - A comprehensive review of the clinical approach to pregnancy and systemic lupus 
SP  - 106-117
AB  - Nowadays, most of the young women affected by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  can carry out one or more pregnancies thanks to the improvement in treatment and  the consequent reduction in morbidity and mortality. Pregnancy outcome in these  women has also greatly improved in the last decades. A correct timing for  pregnancy (tailored on disease activity and established during a preconception  counselling), together with a tight monitoring during the three trimesters and  the post-partum period (to timely identify and treat possible obstetric  complications or maternal disease flares), as well as the concept of  multidisciplinary management, are currently milestones of the management of  pregnancy in SLE patients. Nevertheless, the increasing knowledge on the  compatibility of drugs with pregnancy has allowed a better treatment of these  patients, by choosing medications that control maternal disease activity without  harming the foetus. However, particular attention and strict monitoring should be  dedicated to SLE pregnant women in particular clinical settings: patients with  lupus nephritis and patients with aPL positivity or Antiphospholipid syndrome,  who are at higher risk for maternal and foetal complications, but also patients  with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies, because of the risk of neonatal  lupus. A discussion on family planning, as well as counselling on contraception,  should be part of the everyday-practice for physicians caring for SLE women  during their reproductive age. Another issue is the possible reduction of  fertility in these women, that can be due to different reasons. Consequently, the  request for assisted reproduction techniques has been increasing in the last  years, so that rheumatologists and gynaecologists should be prepared to counsel  SLE patients also in this particular setting.

SP  - 94-105
AB  - Patients affected with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) still display increased  mortality and decreased quality of life in respect to general population. The  major determinant of poor long term prognosis is organ damage, which is  predictive of more damage and death. Damage is in turn triggered by uncontrolled  disease activity and especially by the long-standing corticosteroid use which  often accompanies SLE patients over their disease course, owing both to the need  of reaching disease remission and to the habit of keeping patients on a small  steroid dose for an indefinite period of time. Hence, the need for new drugs and  therapeutic strategies aiming at minimizing damage accrual through a better  control of disease activity and a steroid-sparing potential is paramount. So far,  however, the therapeutic strategy in SLE requires a multitarget approach which is  not devoid of widespread immunesuppression. In fact, several studies have been  carried out in recent years targeting both the adaptive and the innate immune  system, the majority of which did not achieve their primary endpoint, being often  divergent from successful clinical experience and thereby committing physician to  off-label use of targeted therapies in face of refractory SLE manifestations. The  study designs and the chosen endpoints were often blamed for inadequacy, being at  least in part responsible for study failures. In this review, we go over major  clinical trials conducted in SLE by analyzing any critical aspects related to  study design, predefined endpoints and biological activity of novel compounds  that may have hampered study outcome, despite the great effort of providing less  toxic drugs within a targeted, pathogenic-based approach.

SP  - S54-S56
AB  - Recent advances in health information technologies (HIT) in systemic lupus  erythematosus have included electronic databases and registries, computerised  clinical charts for patient monitoring, computerised diagnostic tools,  computerised prediction rules and, more recently, disease-specific applications  for mobile devices for physicians, health care professionals, and patients.  Traditionally, HIT development has been oriented primarily to physicians and  public administrators. However, more recent development of patient-centered Apps  could improve communication and empower patients in the daily management of their  disease. Economic advantages could also result from the use of HIT, including  these Apps by collecting real life data that could be used in both economic  analyses and to improve patient care.

AB  - It is generally believed that significant renal ablation leads to hyperfiltration  and eventually progressively worsening chronic kidney disease. The data behind  this belief have not been scrutinized intensively. More importantly, the above  belief leads many physicians to manage patients differently than they otherwise  would manage. Here, we examine the data behind whether hyperfiltration occurs  when patients lose kidney mass (by excision or by disease) and whether the  hyperfiltration is uniformly injurious.

SP  - 115-118
AB  - Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune skin disease occurring in  association with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although  antimalarials are widely used as the first-line systemic agent, refractory cases  may benefit from additional immunomodulators, immunosuppressives, and biologics.  An interest in biological therapies for CLE has emerged in recent years due to  novel insight into the pathogenesis of CLE. These targets include B cells, T  cells, and cytokines that are involved in immune system pathways. Currently  belimumab is the only biological therapy approved for SLE and no biologic has  been approved for CLE. While there is a paucity of high quality evidence with  regard to biologics in CLE management, trials are currently being performed to  determine their role.

SP  - 137
AB  - BACKGROUND: To perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to  compare the risk of serious infections with immunosuppressive medications and  glucocorticoids in lupus nephritis. METHODS: A trained librarian performed two  searches: (1) PubMed for all lupus nephritis trials from the end dates for the  systematic review for the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) lupus  nephritis treatment guidelines and the 2012 Cochrane Systematic Review on  treatments for lupus nephritis, to September 2013; and (2) PubMed and SCOPUS for  all lupus trials (excluding lupus nephritis) from inception to February 2014, to  obtain additional trials for harms data in any lupus patient. The search  was updated to May 2016. Duplicate title/abstract review and duplicate data  abstractions by two abstractors independently was performed for all eligible  studies, including those studies abstracted for the 2012 ACR lupus nephritis  treatment guidelines and the 2012 Cochrane Systematic Review on lupus nephritis  treatments. We performed a systematic review and a Bayesian NMA, including  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of immunosuppressive drugs or glucocorticoids  in patients with lupus nephritis assessing serious infection risk. Markov chain  Monte Carlo methods were used to model 95 % credible intervals (CrI). Sensitivity  analyses examined the robustness of estimates. RESULTS: A total of 32 RCTs with  2611 patients provided data. There were 26 two-arm, five three-arm, and one  four-arm trials. We found that tacrolimus was associated with significantly lower  risk of serious infections compared to glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide (CYC),  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and azathioprine (AZA) with odds ratios (95 % CrI)  of 0.33 (0.12-0.88), 0.37 (0.15-0.87), 0.340 (0.18-0.81), and 0.32 (0.12-0.81),  respectively. Conversely, CYC low dose (LD), CYC high dose (HD), and HD  glucocorticoids were associated with higher odds of serious infections compared  to tacrolimus, ranging from 4.84 to 12.83. We also found that MMF followed by AZA  (MMF-AZA) was associated with significantly lower risk of serious infections as  compared to CYC LD, CYC HD, CYC-AZA, or HD glucocorticoids with odds ratios (95 %  CrI) of 0.09 (0.01-0.76), 0.07 (0.01-0.54), 0.14 (0.02-0.71), and 0.03  (0.00-0.56), respectively. Estimates were similar to pair-wise meta-analyses.  Sensitivity analyses that varied estimate (odds ratio vs. Peto's odds ratio),  method (random vs. fixed effects model), data (sepsis vs. serious infection data;  exclusion of observational studies), treatment grouping (CYC and CYC HD as a  combined treatment group vs. separate), made little/no difference to these  estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrolimus and MMF-AZA combination were associated with  lower risk of serious infections compared to other immunosuppressive drugs or  glucocorticoids for lupus nephritis. In conjunction with comparative efficacy  data, these data can help patients make informed decisions about treatment  options for lupus nephritis. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42016032965.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of high-quality meta-analyses and network  meta-analyses of immunosuppressive drugs for lupus nephritis. Our objective was  to assess the comparative benefits and harms of immunosuppressive drugs and  corticosteroids in lupus nephritis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and  network meta-analysis (NMA) of trials of immunosuppressive drugs and  corticosteroids in patients with lupus nephritis. We calculated odds ratios (OR)  and 95 % credible intervals (CrI). RESULTS: Sixty-five studies that met inclusion  and exclusion criteria; data were analyzed for renal remission/response (37  trials; 2697 patients), renal relapse/flare (13 studies; 1108 patients),  amenorrhea/ovarian failure (eight trials; 839 patients) and cytopenia (16 trials;  2257 patients). Cyclophosphamide [CYC] low dose (LD) and CYC high-dose (HD) were  less likely than mycophenolate mofetil [MMF] and azathioprine [AZA], CYC LD, CYC  HD and plasmapharesis less likely than cyclosporine [CSA] to achieve renal  remission/response. Tacrolimus [TAC] was more likely than CYC LD to achieve renal  remission/response. MMF and CYC were associated with a lower odds of renal  relapse/flare compared to PRED and MMF was associated with a lower rate of renal  relapse/flare than AZA. CYC was more likely than MMF and PRED to be associated  with amenorrhea/ovarian failure. Compared to MMF, CYC, AZA, CYC LD, and CYC HD  were associated with a higher risk of cytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic  review and NMA, we found important differences between immunosuppressives used  for the treatment of lupus nephritis. Patients and physicians can use this  information for detailed informed consent in a patient-centered approach. Study  limitations of between-study clinical heterogeneity and small sample size with  type II error must be considered when interpreting these findings. PROSPERO:  CRD42016032965.

SP  - 770-779
AB  - Although the treatment options for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have  significantly improved over the past years through the introduction of novel  targeted biologic therapies, there are still some patients who suffer from  refractory and potentially life-threatening courses of the disease. For these  patients autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after  immunoablative chemotherapy provides a promising treatment option with curative  potential. Based on preclinical models, ASCT was first introduced in 1996 and has  since been carried out in approximately 300 patients worldwide. Clinical study  results confirmed a disease-free survival in approximately 50 % of patients after  5 years despite termination of immunosuppressive treatment. By careful patient  selection and improved anti-infection prophylaxis during stem cell therapy,  transplantation-associated mortality could be reduced from an initial 13 % to  currently an average of 6 %. Meanwhile, mechanistic studies have provided proof  of concept that ASCT not only exerts intensified immunosuppressive effects but is  also associated with fundamental qualitative changes of the immune system that  may rewire a chronic autoimmune system into a naive and self-tolerant state: in  other words immune reset. Overall, ASCT for SLE is still reserved for patients  who do not sufficiently respond to standard therapy. Treatment should be carried  out in close cooperation with centers specializing in hematology and only within  the framework of clinical studies.

T1  - Treatments for Lupus Nephritis: A Systematic Review and Network Metaanalysis.
SP  - 1801-1815
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare benefits and harms of lupus nephritis (LN) induction and  maintenance treatments. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and Bayesian  network metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of immunosuppressive  drugs or corticosteroids (CS) in LN. OR and 95% credible intervals (CrI) were  calculated. RESULTS: There were 65 RCT that met inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Significantly lower risk of endstage renal disease (ESRD; 17 studies) was seen  with cyclophosphamide (CYC; OR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.25-0.92) or CYC + azathioprine  (AZA; OR 0.18, 95% CrI 0.05-0.57) compared with standard-dose CS, and with  high-dose (HD) CYC (OR 0.16, 95% CrI 0.03-0.61) or CYC + AZA (OR 0.10, 95% CrI  0.03-0.34) compared with HD CS. HD CS was associated with higher risk of ESRD  compared with CYC (OR 3.59, 95% CrI 1.30-9.86), AZA (OR 2.93, 95% CrI 1.08-8.10),  or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; OR 7.05, 95% CrI 1.66-31.91). Compared with CS, a  significantly higher proportion of patients had renal response (14 studies) when  treated with CYC (OR 1.98, 95% CrI 1.13-3.52), MMF (OR 2.42, 95% CrI 1.27-4.74),  or tacrolimus (TAC; OR 4.20, 95% CrI 1.29-13.68). No differences were noted for  the risk of malignancy (15 studies). The risk of herpes zoster (17 studies) was  as follows: OR (95% CrI) MMF versus CS 4.38 (1.02-23.87), CYC versus CS 6.64  (1.97-25.71), TAC versus CS 9.11 (1.13-70.99), and CYC + AZA versus CS 8.46  (1.99-43.61). CONCLUSION: Renal benefits and the risk of herpes zoster were  higher for immunosuppressive drugs versus CS. Data on relative and absolute  differences are now available, which can be incorporated into patient-physician  discussions related to systemic lupus erythematosus medication use.

T1  - Myelitis and Lupus: Clinical Manifestations, Diagnosis and Treatment. Review.
SP  - 344-348
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects  multiple systems. Myelopathy is one of 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes related to  SLE defined by the American College of Rheumatology. Although infrequent, it is a  severe manifestation, leading to motor and sensory deficits, and sphincter  dysfunction. The pathogenesis is not clearly known, but may be related to  arterial thrombosis and vasculitis. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings,  laboratory tests and the use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.  The standard therapy is the combination of intravenous cyclophosphamide and  glucocorticoids. In refractory disease, other treatments such as plasmapheresis  or rituximab have been used.

T1  - [Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy].
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease which most  often affects women of childbearing age. Pregnancy is therefore an important  issue for the patient and the responsible physician. Pregnancy outcomes in women  with SLE has improved significantly over the latest decades, and current research  initiatives aim towards further improvement. Pregnant women with SLE are still  considered being at various levels of risk. In order to achieve the best possible  outcomes for mother and child, joint care in specialised multidisciplinary teams  including rheumatologists and obstetricians is recommended.

T1  - A critical review of clinical trials in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1122-40
AB  - One challenge in caring for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a  paucity of approved therapeutics for treatment of the diverse disease  manifestations. In the last 60 years, only one drug, belimumab, has been approved  for SLE treatment. Critical evaluation of investigator initiated and  pharma-sponsored randomized controlled trials (RCTs) highlights barriers to  successful drug development in SLE, including disease heterogeneity, inadequate  trial size or duration, insufficient dose finding before initiation of large  trials, handling of background medications, and choice of primary endpoint.  Herein we examine lessons learned from landmark SLE RCTs and subsequent advances  in trial design, as well as discuss efforts to address limitations in current SLE  outcome measures that will improve detection of true therapeutic responses in  future RCTs.

T1  - Rethinking biologics in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 1102-10
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a chronic and devastating complication of systemic lupus  erythematosus. Despite advances in our understanding of LN and the availability  of effective therapies, LN remains a difficult clinical problem, and progression  to end stage renal disease remains a significant challenge. Though the advent of  biologics has revolutionized the treatment of many rheumatological conditions,  and several clinical trials of biologics have been conducted in LN, the promise  of biologics remains unfulfilled. The experience gained from these initial  clinical trials can help tailor approaches in future clinical trials, and the  lessons learned can be applied to find a cure for this condition.

T1  - Targeted B cell therapies in the treatment of adult and pediatric systemic lupus 
SP  - 1086-96
AB  - Belimumab (Benlysta) is a fully-humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits  B-lymphocyte stimulator (also known as B cell activating factor) and was approved  by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration and European Medicines Evaluation Agency  for treatment in adults with autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). Rituximab (Rituxan) is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody targeting  B lymphocytes. This review discusses the key findings of the phase III trials in  adults with SLE and of real-world use of belimumab and rituximab in the care of  both adult and pediatric SLE patients. It highlights the safety profile of  belimumab and rituximab and gives insight into the consideration of these  therapies for specific SLE disease states. It concludes with a discussion of the  current clinical trials investigating B cell therapies in specific SLE disease  states and a look to the future, with ongoing clinical trials.

T1  - Outcomes in Renal Transplant Recipients With Lupus Nephritis-A Single-Center 
SP  - 1489-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal transplantation is the renal replacement therapy of choice in  patients with end-stage lupus nephritis (LN). The aim of this study was to  evaluate the early and late outcomes of renal transplantation in LN patients in a  single transplant center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study analyzed the clinical  data of patients who received a renal transplant (RTx) at Gdansk Transplantation  Centre between January 1999 and December 2014. RESULTS: There were 1296 RTx  performed between January 1999 and December 2014, including 21 RTx in 19 LN  patients (mean age 40 +/- 10 years, 89% female). During the follow-up period  (between 1 month and 10.5 years), 1 patient died of urosepsis and 1 of pneumonia.  Three RTx recipients with antiphospholipid syndrome lost 5 kidney allografts,  including 3 due to acute rejection (AR) during the first posttransplantation  month. Kidney allograft survival median was 64 months. Delayed graft function  (DGF) and AR were observed in 48% and 33% vs 31% and 21% of LN patients and other  RTx patients, respectively (P = .1 and P = .16 for DGF and AR, respectively). The  most common early posttransplantation complications were AR (31%) and perirenal  hematomas (29%), and late complications were urinary tract infections (75%).  Recurrence of LN in renal allograft was observed in 1 patient and was  successfully treated by increasing the basic immunosuppression. CONCLUSIONS:  Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome has a major influence on the outcomes of RTx  in LN patients. Recurrence of LN has no clinical significance.

T1  - Shrinking lung syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus: A 
SP  - 994-1000
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Shrinking lung syndrome (SLS) is a rare respiratory manifestation  of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by dyspnea, chest pain,  elevated hemidiaphragm and a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests.  Here, we report 15 new observations of SLS during SLE and provide a systematic  literature review. We studied the clinical, biological, functional and  morphologic characteristics, the treatments used and their efficacy. METHODS: The  inclusion criteria were all patients with SLE defined by the American College of  Rheumatology criteria Hochberg (1997) , associated with a restrictive pattern on  pulmonary function tests. The exclusion criteria were all differential diagnoses  of restrictive patterns, including obesity and pulmonary fibrosis. The patients  were recruited from local databases through chest physicians, rheumatologists and  internists. The data for the literature review were extracted from the Medline  database using "shrinking lung syndrome" and "lupus" as key words. RESULTS: All  15 new cases were women with a median age at SLS onset of 27years old (range  17-67years). All of them complained of dyspnea and all but one of chest pain. The  antibodies were similar to those found in SLE, although the anti-SS-A was  positive in 10 of 13 cases. Thoracic imaging showed elevated hemidiaphragm  (12/15) and/or basal atelectasia (8/15). All of the patients had an isolated  restrictive pattern on PFT, with a median decrease >50% of lung volume. All of  the patients were treated, using corticosteroids (11/15), immunosuppressive drugs  (8/15), beta-mimetics (2/15), physiotherapy (3/15) and/or colchicine (1/15).  Improvement was described in 9 of 12 patients and stability in 3 of 12. We  extracted 155 cases of SLE-associated SLS from the Medline database. The  clinical, biological and functional parameters were similar to our cases.  Clinical improvement was described in 48 of 52 cases (94%) and PFT improvement in  36 of 47 cases. Worsening occurred in 4 cases. CONCLUSION: SLS is a rare SLE  manifestation. Pain and parietal inflammation seem to play important pathogenic  roles. Steroids and antalgics are the most commonly used therapies with good  responses. There is no proof of efficacy with immunosuppressive drugs for this  entity. Rituximab can be discussed after failure of corticosteroids, as well as  antalgics, theophylline and beta-mimetics.

T1  - Reproductive aspects of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 57-65
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an auto-immune systemic disease showing a  strong predilection for women of reproductive age. Higher prevalance of SLE among  young women are in part accounted for by the effects of estrogen hormone on  immune system. The key pathophysiological features of this disease are the  generation of autoantibodies and the deposition of antibody-antigen complexes in  the basal membranes of the organs where they evoke inflammatory responses and  injury. Young females diagnosed with SLE are more prone to developing a multitude  of adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes, especially in the presence of  active disease. Our motivation in writing this review article is to outline the  recent interesting findings of molecular and clinical studies showing  multi-faceted roles of estrogen hormone in both normal immune function and  auto-immunity and to provide an update on the ovarian function and other poor  reproductive outcomes in young females with SLE.

SP  - 761-766
AB  - We describe two cases of non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and  multifocal stenosis of the intracranial arteries. The patients' histories  together with magnetic resonance angiography, vessel wall imaging and  transcranial Doppler (TCD) indicated that the SAH was due to vasculitis or  reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Differential diagnosis of  vasculitis and RCVS is important because the treatment strategies are different:  immunosuppressants in vasculitis and calcium channel blockers in RCVS. Vessel  wall magnetic resonance imaging and TCD can be helpful in differentiating them.

T1  - Current Perspectives on Arthroplasty in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Rates, 
SP  - 59
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic debilitating condition with  significant impact on the musculoskeletal system. Arthroplasty may be indicated  for damage related to active lupus or its treatment. As therapies for SLE have  advanced, morbidity and mortality have declined, while the rate of joint  replacement has increased. The age of SLE patients undergoing arthroplasty is  increasing, and the indication for surgery is evolving-while avascular necrosis  was previously the predominant indication for arthroplasty, osteoarthritis now  accounts for a larger proportion of surgeries. Pain and functional outcomes of  arthroplasty in SLE patients are comparable to those of the general population  with osteoarthritis, but lupus remains an independent risk factor for post-hip  arthroplasty complications and mortality. Further research is needed to  characterize the impact of lupus disease activity and severity on arthroplasty  outcomes.

SP  - e4272
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune multiorgan  disorder of unknown etiology. It affects both men and women, but with different  disease manifestations of differing disease severity and in varying proportion,  with a female predominance of approximately 90%. There have been numerous studies  addressing this issue, especially its implications in relation to optimal  sex-tailored treatment and improvement of survival rate; however, further  research is warranted. A meta-analysis of studies was performed to compare the  impact of sex on the clinical outcomes of SLE in different populations. METHODS:  A literature search of the MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases (until January  2016) was conducted to identify relevant articles. Clinical manifestations  reported in these patients were considered as endpoints for this meta-analysis.  Two independent reviewers determined eligibility criteria. A fixed-effect model  has been used where a small heterogeneity was observed, or else, a random-effect  model has been used among the studies. Odd ratio (OR) with 95% confidence  interval (CI) was used to express the pooled effect on dichotomous variables, and  the pooled analyses were performed with RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Sixteen studies  consisting of a total of 11,934 SLE patients (10,331 females and 1603 males) have  been included in this meta-analysis. The average female-to-male ratio of all the  included studies is around 9.3:1. Several statistically significant differences  were found: alopecia, photosensitivity, and oral ulcers were significantly higher  in female patients (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.29-0.46, P < 0.00001; OR 0.72, 95% CI  0.63-0.83, P < 0.00001; and OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60-0.82, P < 0.00001,  respectively). Malar rash was significantly higher in female patients (OR 0.68,  95% CI 0.53-0.88, P = 0.003), and arthritis was significantly lower in male  patients (OR 0.72, 95% CI 1.25-1.84, P < 0.00001). However, serositis and  pleurisies were significantly higher in female patients (OR 1.52, 95% CI  1.25-1.84 P < 0.0001; and OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07-1.48, P = 0.006, respectively).  Renal involvement was higher in male patients (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.31-1.75,  P < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that  alopecia, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, arthritis, malar rash, lupus  anticoagulant level, and low level of C3 were significantly higher in female  lupus patients, whereas renal involvement, serositis and pleurisies,  thrombocytopenia, and anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid level were  predominant in male patients.

T1  - Sjogren Syndrome: Why Do Clinical Trials Fail?
SP  - 519-30
AB  - Sjogren syndrome (SS) comprises glandular and extraglandular manifestations.  Double-blind prospective trials of traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic  drugs and biologics have failed because they have not improved benign symptoms,  the major cause of lowered quality of life. Rituximab has proven effective in SS  patients with associated mixed cryoglobulinemia, parotid gland swelling,  lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, thrombocytopenia, and other manifestations.  There were few of these SS patients in the trials required for FDA approval. Most  patients had benign symptoms and did not show benefit, leading to failure of the  study. This article examines the reasons for these failures and proposes future  directions.

SP  - 1154-60
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is the most common connective tissue disease that is  associated with pulmonary manifestations. Although lupus has the potential to  affect any organ, lung involvement is observed during the course of the disease  in most cases and it is prognostic for outcome. Pulmonary manifestations in lupus  can be classified into five groups based on the anatomical involvement: pleura,  lung parenchyma, bronchi and bronchioli, lung vasculature and respiratory muscles  can be involved. The most common respiratory manifestations attributable to lupus  are pleuritis with or without pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular disease, upper  and lower airway dysfunction, parenchymal disease, and diaphragmatic dysfunction  (shrinking lung syndrome). In this article the authors summarize lung involvement  of lupus, its diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. Orv. Hetil., 2016, 157(29),  1154-1160.

T1  - Wernicke's encephalopathy mimicking neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with 
SP  - 195-199
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease that  involves many organs and systems. Nervous system involvement in SLE encompasses  neurological and psychiatric disorders, and remains a diagnostic and therapeutic  challenge. Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological disorder that occurs  as a consequence of thiamine deficiency, and its clinical presentation resembles  the neuropsychiatric events attributed to SLE (NPSLE). Differentiation between  these two entities is crucial because their treatment differs greatly and can  change prognosis. We describe three cases of patients with SLE who presented with  initial clinical findings suggestive of NPSLE that, at the end of a thorough  clinical investigation, were actually found to represent WE. In all of these  cases, treatment with thiamine resulted in significant improvement. WE should be  considered as a differential diagnosis in SLE patients with neuropsychiatric  signs and symptoms, especially when risk factors for thiamine deficiency are  present.

T1  - Treat to target in systemic lupus erythematosus: a commentary.
SP  - 1903-1907
AB  - Treat to target (T2T) strategies have proved to be useful in several chronic  disorders, including Rheumatoid Arthritis. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  T2T strategy has been proposed in order to control disease activity, improve  health-related quality of life, and reduce morbidity and mortality. Remission  would be the main target, but a low disease activity state (LDAS) could be an  acceptable alternative. However, due to SLE protean manifestations, the  operational definitions of both remission and LDAS are still in progress. The  definitions of these targets, remission and LDAS, should include a validated  disease activity index, the treatments allowed, and the minimum length of time  the target should be maintained. Furthermore, achieving these targets should  result in better disease outcomes such as reducing damage accrual. This review  addresses the current state regarding these possible targets in SLE and the  impact of achieving them in intermediate and long-term outcomes of this disease.

T1  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Biologic Therapeutics for 
SP  - 107-125
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease with  potentially severe clinical manifestation that mainly affects women of  child-bearing age. Patients who do not respond to standard-of-care therapies,  such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, require biologic therapeutics  that specifically target a single or multiple SLE pathogenesis pathways. This  review summarizes the clinical pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic  characteristics of biologic agents that are approved, used off-label, or in the  active pipeline of drug development for SLE patients. Depending on the type of  target, the interacting biologics may exhibit linear (non-specific) or non-linear  (target-mediated) disposition profiles, with terminal half-lives varying from  approximately 1 week to 1 month. Biologics given by subcutaneous administration,  which offers dosing flexibility over intravenous administration, demonstrated a  relatively slow absorption with a time to maximum concentration of approximately  1 day to 2 weeks and a variable bioavailability of 30-82 %. The population  pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies were best described by a  two-compartment model with central clearance and steady-state volume of  distribution ranging from 0.176 to 0.215 L/day and 3.60-5.29 L, respectively. The  between-subject variability in pharmacokinetic parameters were moderate (20-79 %)  and could be partially explained by body size. The development of linked  pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models incorporating SLE disease biomarkers are  an attractive strategy for use in dosing regimen simulation and optimization. The  relationship between efficacy/adverse events and biologic concentration should be  evaluated to improve clinical trial outcomes, especially for biologics in the  advanced phase of drug development. New strategies, such as model-based precision  dosing dashboards, could be utilized to incorporate information collected from  therapeutic drug monitoring into pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models to enable  individualized dosing in real time.

T1  - Insights into the epidemiology and management of lupus nephritis from 
SP  - 487-92
AB  - Lupus nephritis is a common and severe manifestation of systemic lupus  erythematosus that disproportionately affects nonwhites and those in lower  socioeconomic groups. This review discusses recent data on the incidence,  prevalence, and outcomes of patients with lupus nephritis with a focus on  low-income US Medicaid patients. We also review recent guidelines on diagnosis,  treatment, and screening for new onset and relapses of lupus nephritis. Finally,  we discuss the management of lupus nephritis from a rheumatologist's perspective,  including vigilance for the common adverse events related to disease and  treatment, and we review prevention and new treatment strategies.

T1  - Overview of pathophysiology and treatment of human lupus nephritis.
SP  - 460-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite recent developments and treatment successes, the  outcome, and prognosis of patients with lupus nephritis (LuN) have not greatly  changed since the 1980s. This review covers the application of new concepts to  the understanding of renal inflammation and the study of new pharmacologic agents  to improve patient outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have shown that the  presence of anti-vimentin antibodies and T follicular helper cells in patient  biopsies is associated with more severe interstitial inflammation, which has been  tied to faster disease progression and onset of end-stage renal disease.  Additionally, data regarding the role of serum IgE antidouble-stranded DNA  antibodies in LuN by means of mediating IFN1 production by plasmacytoid dendritic  cells are highlighted. Finally, a thorough review of completed and currently open  clinical trials of therapeutic agents is provided. SUMMARY: Current management of  LuN is guided almost exclusively by glomerular involvement. Based on the data  provided in this review, we argue that renal tubulointerstitial inflammation is  no less important and represents an overlooked feature in the current clinical  approach to patients. Tubulointerstitial inflammation is driven by both adaptive  and innate immune mechanisms that are still poorly understood. Studying these  pathogenic processes promises to reveal new therapeutic opportunities for those  LuN patients with the worst prognosis.

T1  - Update on the pathogenesis and treatment of childhood-onset systemic lupus 
SP  - 488-96
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article will provide an update of studies published in  the last year regarding epidemiology, pathogenesis, major disease manifestations  and outcomes, and therapies in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus  (cSLE). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies on cSLE epidemiology supported previous  findings that cSLE patients have more severe disease and tend to accumulate  damage rapidly. Lupus nephritis remains frequent and is still a significant cause  of morbidity and mortality. In the past year unfortunately there were no new  reproducible, biomarker studies to help direct therapy of renal disease. However,  some progress was made in neuropsychiatric disease assessment, with a new and  promising automated test to screen for cognitive dysfunction reported. There were  no prospective interventional treatment trials designed for patients with cSLE  published in the last year, but some studies involving children are currently  active and might improve the therapeutic options for patients with cSLE. SUMMARY:  There is a need to get a better understanding of pathogenesis and identify new  biomarkers in cSLE to more accurately predict outcomes. New insights into  characterization of different clinical manifestations may enable to optimize  individual interventions and influence the prognosis.

T1  - Update on clinical trials in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 477-87
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: With advancement in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms  in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), there is tremendous enthusiasm in  examining drugs, old and new, to improve outcomes. This review highlights recent  trials' successes and impasses that have come to fore. RECENT FINDINGS: Among  B-cell therapies, belimumab continues its run of successes with sustained safety  and tolerability documented in a long-term extension as well as the likely  approval of a subcutaneous formulation in the near future. With greater  antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and less immunogenicity, there is hope for  obinituzumab to succeed where its anti-CD 20 predecessors have failed. Drugs  targeting type I interferons - sifalimumab and anifrolumab - have been  efficacious albeit with an increase in incidence of Herpes zoster infections.  There is also renewed interest in evaluating the efficacy of calcineurin  inhibitors, specifically tacrolimus in the induction and maintenance of lupus  nephritis. Introspection into clinical trial designs have highlighted the effects  of entry criteria, end points, background medications and geographical  differences on study outcomes. SUMMARY: There are at least 50 drugs and targets  being evaluated in SLE. In addition to developing new drugs to treat lupus,  future trials have to focus on more effective study designs to improve chances of  trial success.

T1  - How the microbiota shapes rheumatic diseases.
SP  - 398-411
AB  - The human gut harbours a tremendously diverse and abundant microbial community  that correlates with, and even modulates, many health-related processes. The  mucosal interfaces are particularly active sites of microorganism-host interplay.  Growing insight into the characteristic composition and functionality of the  mucosal microbiota has revealed that the microbiota is involved in mucosal  barrier integrity and immune function. This involvement affects proinflammatory  and anti-inflammatory processes not only at the epithelial level, but also at  remote sites such as the joints. Here, we review the role of the gut microbiota  in shaping local and systemic immune responses and how disturbances in the  host-microorganism interplay can potentially affect the development and  progression of rheumatic diseases. Increasing our understanding of how to promote  host-microorganism homeostasis could therefore reveal novel strategies for the  prevention or alleviation of rheumatic disease.

T1  - [Off-label use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in the treatment of lupus 
SP  - 204-209
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Several case reports have reported the benefit of intravenous  immunoglobulin therapy in many autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus  erythematosus. CASE REPORTS: Here, we report on two cases of lupus myocarditis  treated with high dose of intravenous immunoglobulin. The first patient was a  42-year-old woman who presented with lupus myocarditis that was resistant to  corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and who was finally successfully treated  with a single dose of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient displayed  clinical improvement a few days later. The second case - a 43-year-old woman was  diagnosed with lupus myocarditis and immunosuppressive drugs were contraindicated  because of the context of a recent infective endocarditis. She was treated with  repeated dose of 2 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulin. Clinical improvement was  observed and the left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 20 % to 60 %  within a few days. We also report 9 similar observations identified from a  literature review. CONCLUSION: The use of intravenous immunoglobulin in lupus  myocarditis is not officially recognized but could be considered as an  alternative when conventional therapies have failed or are contraindicated.

T1  - [Immune system and rheumatic diseases in the elderly].
SP  - 794-6
AB  - Impairments of the immune system play an important role in all immun-mediated  rheumatic diseases. Recently, the following news were reported: . Early aging of  the immune system with thymus insufficiency has now been reported for both  patients with rheumatoid arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis, without prethymic  lack of progenitors at least in rheumatoid arthritis.. . For giant cell  arteritis, the most frequent vasculitis in the elderly, an increased expression  of IL-17A in temporal artery biopsies coincides with good prognosis and reponse  to glucocorticoids.. . Concerning immunosenescence in systemic lupus  erythematosus, BAFF appears to have an important role for relapses after B-cell  depletion.. For the future it can be anticipated that the use of unified  classification criteria for rheumatic diseases (as with the new 2012 EULAR / ACR  classification criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica) will ensure better  comparability of immunological studies also in the elderly.

SP  - 857-63
AB  - In this review we critically analyze pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cardiac  manifestations of childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE). Clinical  manifestations of these organ systems may be the initial manifestation of cSLE;  frequently occur with very active cSLE; and are potential life-threatening  manifestations often presenting to the emergency department and requiring  admission to the intensive care unit. Early recognition and treatment of the  pulmonary, gastrointestinal and cardiac manifestations of cSLE will result in  improved prognosis and better outcomes.

T1  - Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease: a diagnostic dilemma.
SP  - 1069-75
AB  - Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a benign, self-limiting condition characterized by  lymphadenopathy and fever. Its diagnosis can be challenging, as the disease must  be differentiated from lymphoma and systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients can  present with nonspecific cutaneous lesions. Adequate clinical and histopathologic  correlation can aid in the timely diagnosis of Kikuchi's disease, thus preventing  the use of unnecessary diagnostic procedures and inappropriate treatments.

T1  - [Prognosis and progress in immunotherapies for organ involvements in systemic 
SP  - 8-17
AB  - Treatment of organ involvements accompanied by systemic autoimmune diseases is  still challenging for clinicians, reminding the existence of unmet needs. Among  them, lupus nephritis (LN), neuropsychiatric lupus, interstitial lung diseases  (ILD) complicated with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) or systemic sclerosis  (SSc) are the most severe conditions with poor prognosis. Because of the rarity  and severity of the disease status, and of variety in evaluation methods,  randomized clinical trials tend to be difficult in recruiting patients, in  designing protocols, and in meeting primary endpoints. In such tough conditions,  superiority of IVCY over corticosteroids alone for LN has been established, which  is now going to be replaced by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Moreover,  non-inferiority of tacrolimus to MMF is reported and efficacy of biologics such  as Rituximab and Abatacept for LN is under investigation. In contrast, PM/DM-ILD  is not suitable for randomized controlled trial because of the severity/acute  progression in some patients. Intensive immunosuppressive regimen is recommended  for those with poor prognostic factor(s). Cyclophosphamide has limited efficacy  in SSc-ILD. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation elongated patient survival  and improved ILD, but with high treatment-related mortality rate. Efficacy of  rituximab and MMF has been reported in small-sized trials. In this review,  previously established treatment as well as emerging immunotherapies for organ  involvements will be discussed. Our experiences in autoimmune settings also will  be introduced.

T1  - Immunogenicity and impact on disease activity of influenza and pneumococcal 
SP  - 1664-72
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to assess the immunogenicity and the impact on disease  activity of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines in SLE patients. METHODS: We  conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies comparing  the humoral response of either pneumococcal (serotype 23F) or influenza (AH1N1,  AH3N2 and B strains) vaccines between SLE patients and healthy controls, assessed  by a seroconversion or a seroprotection rate 3-6 weeks after vaccination. The  impact on disease activity was assessed by the comparison of the SLEDAI score  before and 3-8 weeks after vaccination. Odds ratios (ORs), risk ratios and their  95% CIs were pooled using the generic inverse variance method. RESULTS: Twenty  studies were included, three for pneumococcal vaccine and 17 for influenza  vaccine, gathering 1665 SLE patients and 826 healthy controls. For pneumococcal  vaccination, no significant difference was observed, either for seroconversion  rate between SLE patients and controls or for the SLEDAI score. For influenza  vaccination, the response against AH1N1 was significantly reduced in SLE  patients, with a lower rate of seroconversion (OR = 0.38; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.54; P <  0.00001, I(2) = 39%) and seroprotection (OR = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.47; P <  0.00001, I(2) = 25%). For AH3N2, only seroprotection rate was significantly lower  in SLE patients (OR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.50; P < 0.0001, I(2) = 21%). For B  strain, neither seroconversion nor seroprotection rates were significantly  different. Influenza vaccine did not modify the SLEDAI score. CONCLUSION: The  immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in SLE patients depends on the viral strains.  A reduced immunogenicity against influenza A is noted, while the immunogenicity  against the B strain is preserved. The pneumococcal vaccine against 23F serotype  has a preserved immunogenicity. These vaccines have no impact on the SLEDAI  score.

SP  - 306-12
AB  - Systemic autoimmune diseases especially affect young women during childbearing  age. The aim of this review is to update systemic lupus erythematosus,  antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic sclerosis management during pregnancy.  These diseases present variable maternal and fetal risks. Studies show that an  appropriate disease control and a reasonable remission period prior to pregnancy  are associated with satisfactory obstetric outcomes. Antiphospholipid  autoantibodies profile, anti-Ro/anti-La antibodies, pulmonary pressure and  activity evaluation are crucial to assess the pregnancy risk. Monitoring requires  a multidisciplinary team, serial analytic controls and Doppler ultrasound of  maternal and fetal circulation. Evaluation of the activity of the disease is  essential.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus-related hypercalcemia with ectopic calcinosis.
SP  - 1023-6
AB  - We report a case of a 39-year-old female with active systemic lupus erythematosus  who complained of lethargy and weakness with a moderate renal impairment.  Hypercalcemia was confirmed by laboratory examination. Her X-ray revealed  significant ectopic calcinosis in subcutaneous tissue of bilateral hands, and  Tc-99(m) methylene diphosphonate bone scan revealed a remarkably intense uptake  of bilateral lungs. She had no evidence suggestive of other diseases related to  hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. She had abnormally high  serum parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) which fell to normal after  treatment. Glucocorticoid, cyclophosphamide plus calcitonin and etidronate were  administered and the patient improved greatly. Literature review demonstrated  that lupus-related hypercalcemia with ectopic calcinosis is a rare complication  and increased PTHrP is probably one of the main mechanisms. Lung uptake in bone  scan may be a special and reliable clue suggestive of hypercalcemia.

T1  - Pregnancy and contraception in systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 590-600
AB  - A causal link has long been described between estrogen and systemic lupus  erythematosus activity. Contraceptive and pregnancy management is now common for  lupus patients, but pregnancy continues to be associated with higher maternal and  fetal mortality/morbidity in systemic lupus erythematosus patients than among the  general population. Potential complications include lupus flares, obstetric  complications (fetal loss, in utero growth retardation, premature birth) and  neonatal lupus syndrome. Association with antiphospholipid antibodies or  antiphospholipid syndrome increases the risk of obstetric complications. Anti-SSA  and/or anti-SSB antibodies put fetuses at risk for neonatal lupus. Improving the  outcome of such pregnancies depends upon optimal systematic planning of pregnancy  at a preconception counseling visit coupled with a multidisciplinary approach.  Absence of lupus activity, use of appropriate medication during pregnancy based  on the patient's medical history and risk factors, and regular monitoring  constitute the best tools for achieving a favorable outcome in such high-risk  pregnancies. The aim of this review is to provide an update on the management of  contraception and pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous lupus  and/or antiphospholipid syndrome in order to reduce the risk of complications and  to ensure the best maternal and fetal prognosis.

T1  - Towards patient stratification and treatment in the autoimmune disease lupus 
SP  - 46-58
AB  - Drug development in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) has been hindered by poor  translation from successful preclinical experiments to clinical efficacy. This  lack of success has been attributed to the high heterogeneity of SLE patients and  to the lack of understanding of disease physiopathology. Modelling approaches  could be useful for supporting the identification of targets, biomarkers and  patient subpopulations with differential response to drugs. However, the use of  traditional quantitative models based on differential equations is not  justifiable in a sparse data situation. Boolean networks models are less  demanding on the required data to be implemented and can provide insights into  the dynamics of biological networks. This methodology allows the integration of  all the available knowledge into a single framework to evaluate the behavior of  the system under different conditions and test hypotheses about unknown aspects  of the disease. In this proof-of-concept study, we explored the potential of a  systems pharmacology model based on Boolean networks to support drug development  in SLE. We focused the analysis on the antigen presentation by the antigen  presenting cells (APC) to the T-cells to evaluate the scope of this methodology  in a medium size network before full implementation of the whole SLE pathway. The  heterogeneity of SLE patients was replicated using this methodology simulating  subjects with distinct pathway alterations. A perturbation analysis of the  network coupled with clustering analysis showed potential to identify drug  targets, optimal combinatorial regimens and subpopulations of responders and  non-responders to drug treatment. We propose this approach as a first step  towards the development of more quantitative platforms to address the current  challenges in drug development for complex diseases.

T1  - Efficacy and Safety of Belimumab Plus Standard Therapy in Patients With Systemic 
SP  - 1134-40
AB  - PURPOSE: The treatment of belimumab plus standard therapy in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been studied extensively in recent years.  Our aim was to estimate the efficacy and safety of this therapy compared with  placebo plus standard therapy in patients with SLE. METHODS: PubMed, Web of  Science, Embase, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM, Chinese), and  Wanfang Database (Chinese) were searched for all randomized clinical trials that  mainly studied the efficacy and safety of belimumab plus standard therapy before  June 2015. We extracted or calculated the rate of the SLE Response Index and  adverse event rate at 52 weeks in all the included studies. The odds ratio (OR)  with 95% CI between the 2 groups in this meta-analysis was conducted by using a  random-effects model. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were also  performed. All statistical tests were performed by using Stata software version  12.0 (StataCorp., College Station, Texas). FINDINGS: In the overall samples (4  studies, N = 4692 ), a significantly higher SLE Response Index rate at 52 weeks  was found in belimumab plus standard therapy group compared with the placebo plus  standard therapy group in all studies (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26-1.77 ; P < 0.001  ). When assessed with the incidence of serious adverse events, the data revealed  that there was no significant difference between the 2 groups, with pooled OR =  1.08; 95% CI, 0.83-1.39; P = 0.573; OR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48; P = 0.029; and  OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.88-1.29; P = 0.506. IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that  treatment with belimumab plus standard therapy is more effective than placebo  plus standard therapy in SLE patients, which represents major progress in the  treatment of SLE. Regardless of the statistical analyses, further research is  necessary to optimize treatment effects.

T1  - Standard of treatment and outcomes of adults with lupus nephritis in Africa: a 
SP  - 1269-77
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a significant cause of mortality and  morbidity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the severity of  disease has been described to be increased in Africans. Observational studies  have been conducted; however, the treatment and outcome of African patients with  LN has not been rigorously assessed. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of  studies selected from a PubMed search of outcome in Africans with biopsy-proven  LN from 1 January 1990 to 30 June 2015. Studies that gave information on  histology, treatment and outcome of patients were included. RESULTS: Sixteen  studies were selected from a search that yielded 302 papers; half were from North  Africa, 2/16 (12.5%) were prospective studies and 2/16 (12.5%) were multi-centre  studies. The sample size of reported biopsies in the studies ranged from 22 to  246 patients. Only 3/16 (18.8%) studies used more recent criteria for the  classification and reporting of renal histology, and proliferative LN (class III  and IV) were reported with increased frequency from the studies. For induction  therapy, all the studies reported use of corticosteroids while 15/16 (93.8%) of  the studies also used cyclophosphamide (CYC) as an induction agent. Overall  mortality rates ranged from 7.9% to 34.9% with increased disease activity, kidney  failure and infections cited as common causes of mortality. Five-year renal  survival was 48-84% while five-year patient survival was 54%-94%. Survival rates  were higher for studies reported from North Africa. CONCLUSION: This analysis  highlights diagnostic challenges in LN in Africa and shows that a  CYC/glucocorticoid-based regimen remains the standard of treatment for adult  patients. The contributions of this therapy to reported outcomes of LN in Africa  require further exploration.

T1  - Connective tissue diseases, multimorbidity and the ageing lung.
SP  - 1535-58
AB  - Connective tissue diseases encompass a wide range of heterogeneous disorders  characterised by immune-mediated chronic inflammation often leading to tissue  damage, collagen deposition and possible loss of function of the target organ.  Lung involvement is a common complication of connective tissue diseases.  Depending on the underlying disease, various thoracic compartments can be  involved but interstitial lung disease is a major contributor to morbidity and  mortality. Interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension or both are found  most commonly in systemic sclerosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of connective  tissue diseases continues to rise due to both longer life expectancy and more  effective and better-tolerated treatments. In the geriatric population,  connective tissue diseases are almost invariably accompanied by age-related  comorbidities, and disease- and treatment-related complications, which contribute  to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with these conditions, and  complicate treatment decision-making. Connective tissue diseases in the elderly  represent a growing concern for healthcare providers and an increasing burden of  global health resources worldwide. A better understanding of the mechanisms  involved in the regulation of the immune functions in the elderly and  evidence-based guidelines specifically designed for this patient population are  instrumental to improving the management of connective tissue diseases in elderly  patients.

T1  - Rituximab in lupus nephritis: A non-systematic review.
SP  - 210-5
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and severe complication in patients with lupus.  Current therapy is based on immunosuppressive drugs and glucocorticoids.  Recently, rituximab has been proposed as an alternative treatment for LN.  Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen receptor on  B cells. The aim of this review is to summarize all the available information  about rituximab in LN. Eleven studies were found; three of them were  observational studies (2 prospective and 1 retrospective) and eight were clinical  trials (7 open-label studies and only 1 randomized controlled trial [RCT]). The  evidence is insufficient to establish the role of rituximab in the treatment of  LN. Results from the only RCT, which were negative, suggest a clinical benefit in  black people. Further studies must confirm this hypothesis. Controlled clinical  trials involving adaptive randomization are required to establish the real  benefit of rituximab in LN.

T1  - The BAFFling effects of rituximab in lupus: danger ahead?
SP  - 367-72
AB  - Suboptimal trial design and concurrent therapies are thought to account for the  unexpected failure of two clinical trials of rituximab in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, in this Opinion article we propose an  alternative explanation: that rituximab can trigger a sequence of events that  exacerbates disease in some patients with SLE. Post-rituximab SLE flares that are  characterized by high levels of antibodies to double-stranded DNA are associated  with elevated circulating BAFF (B-cell-activating factor, also known as TNF  ligand superfamily member 13B or BLyS) levels, and a high proportion of  plasmablasts within the B-cell pool. BAFF not only perpetuates autoreactive B  cells (including plasmablasts), particularly when B-cell numbers are low, but  also stimulates T follicular helper (TFH) cells. Moreover, plasmablasts and TFH  cells promote each others' formation. Thus, repeated rituximab infusions can  result in a feedback loop characterized by ever-rising BAFF levels, surges in  autoantibody production and worsening of disease. We argue that B-cell depletion  should be swiftly followed by BAFF inhibition in patients with SLE.

T1  - [Gynecological cancers in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases].
SP  - 63-7
AB  - The risk of gynecological cancers in patients with inflammatory rheumatic  diseases only seems to be elevated with respect to cervical cancer and mainly in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. There is increasing evidence for an  influence of the immune system on tumor control of gynecological malignancies;  however, an adverse influence of immunosuppressive treatment in rheumatic  patients was indicated only for the risk of cervical cancer. In contrast,  biologics could not be shown to cause an increased risk of cervical cancer but  data on this topic are limited. General screening recommendations exist for  breast cancer and cervical cancer. Recommendations for follow-up after  oncological treatment are presented. Because of limited evidence  immunosuppressive and biological treatment should be applied with great restraint  at least within the first 5 years after curative oncological treatment also for  gynecological tumors. As far as breast cancer is concerned an even longer  interval is under discussion.

T1  - Organ Damage and Quality of Life in Antiphospholipid Syndrome.
SP  - 7
AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) affects young patients in the most productive  years of their life, and the consequences of organic or tissue damage involve a  decrease in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While acute disease  manifestations of APS are well known, information on the long-term prognosis and  damage in affected patients is still very limited. Systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) patients would be expected to experience long-term complications and even  die as a consequence of APS. Organ damage in APS has been evaluated using  different methods and definitions, including the SLICC/ACR Damage Index (SDI),  which tend to underestimate aPL-related damage. A new damage index in APS has  been proposed (DIAPS), and it seems to be more accurate than SDI. Given the  implications for morbidity and mortality, it is imperative to assess accurately  aPL-related damage and HRQoL in patients with APS.

T1  - [Treat-to-target in rheumatology].
SP  - 259-64
AB  - The treat-to target concept has been widely used in many chronic devastating  disorders (like hypertension, diabetes meilitus, caraiovascuiar diseases) for  many years. It has been initiated in the cardiovascular diseases treatment where,  based on vast clinical databases, it had been proven that the achievement of  certain therapeutical results (e.g. blood pressure lowering<140/90; target for  HbAlc less than 7%; normalization of lipid concentration) lead to significant  reduction of cardiovascular accidents and improved long-term prognosis.The main  principles of treat-to-target concept are deeply rooted in the humanistic  tradition and nature of medical science including: cooperation between doctor and  patient based on mutual understanding, achievement of remission due to effective  treatment, avoidance of damage and improvement of patient's quality of life. The  principles of T2T were first applied in rheumatic diseases in 2010 to plan the  treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The application of T2T in rheumatoid arthritis  treatment, where the achievement of remission or low disease activity can be  quite accurately quantified, is now quite widespread. The principles forT2T  application within ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and lately  systemic lupus erythematosus have been desianed. This study is aimed at making  the readers familiar with T2T concept and suggesting the ways of its clinical  application.

T1  - Dyslipidemia in systemic lupus erythematosus: just another comorbidity?
SP  - 604-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, dyslipidemia is  believed to decisively affect the long-term prognosis of lupus patients, not only  with regard to cardiovascular events but also by influencing other  manifestations, such as lupus nephritis. The aim of this study was to review the  epidemiology, pathogenesis, evidence for its impact on atherosclerosis  manifestations and management of dyslipidemia in lupus patients. METHODS:  English-restricted MEDLINE database search (Medical Subject Headings: lupus or  systemic lupus erythematosus and dyslipidemia or hyperlipidemia). RESULTS: The  prevalence of dyslipidemia in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) ranges from 36%  at diagnosis to 60% or even higher after 3 years, depending on definition.  Multiple pathogenetic mechanisms are implicated, including antibodies against  lipoprotein lipase and cytokines affecting the balance between pro- and  anti-atherogenic lipoproteins. Dyslipidemia has a clear impact on clinical  cardiovascular disease and surrogate markers for subclinical atherosclerosis.  Moreover, it negatively affects end-organ damage (kidneys and brain). Treatment  with statins yielded contradictory results as per minimizing cardiovascular risk.  CONCLUSIONS: Dyslipidemia is a significant comorbidity of lupus patients with  multiple negative effects in the long term. Its treatment represents a modifiable  risk factor; prompt and adequate treatment can minimize unnecessary burden in  lupus patients, thus reducing hospitalizations and their overall morbidity and  mortality.

T1  - The Efficacy and Safety of Leflunomide for the Treatment of Lupus Nephritis in 
SP  - e0144548
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of leflunomide as a new  immunosuppressive medicine in lupus nephritis (LN) through a meta-analysis.  METHODS: A systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of leflunomide  compared with cyclophosphamide in adult patients with LN was performed. Data from  relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed before December 2014 was  collected from several databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI and  CBM). No language restrictions were applied. Efficacy outcomes included overall  remission, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, 24-hour proteinuria and  serum creatinine. Safety data were analyzed. The effects of treatment on these  outcomes were summarized as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals  (CIs) and mean differences were pooled using a fixed or random effects model.  RESULTS: Eleven RCTs with Jadad score of 3 or greater were identified and  included a total of 254 patients. Cyclophosphamide was served as the control drug  in all trials. The SLEDAI score, urine protein level and serum creatinine  decreased significantly following leflunomide treatment (P<0.05). Leflunomide was  superior to cyclophosphamide in achieving complete and total remission, but no  difference in SLEDAI score was found between these two treatments (P>0.05).  Additionally, patients receiving leflunomide treatment showed favorable renal  function profiles, especially regarding the 24-hour proteinuria (mean difference:  -0.58, 95%CI: -0.78~-0.37, P<0.01) and serum creatinine (mean difference: -0.20,  95%CI: -0.39~-0.01, P<0.05). In the safety comparison, leflunomide was safer than  cyclophosphamide regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), including liver damage  (RR = 0.53, 95%CI: 0.33~0.87, P<0.05), alopecia (RR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.17~0.85,  P<0.05), leukopenia (RR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.08~0.77, P<0.05) and infection (RR =  0.54, 95%CI: 0.32~0.92, P<0.05), without increased risk of gastrointestinal  reaction, rash or herpes zoster infection. CONCLUSIONS: Leflunomide is a  promising therapy for LN treatment, primarily because of the comparable efficacy  and favorable safety profile determined by this meta-analysis of RCTs. Larger  RCTs with longer duration of observation are necessary to provide strong evidence  of the efficacy and safety of leflunomide in LN patients.

T1  - Survival and prognostic factors of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated 
SP  - 250-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the survival of patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by a  systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies were searched from MEDLINE  (OVID), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial and Scopus  databases, and were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Two independent reviewers extracted data from selected studies. Quality  assessments were also performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All pooled  analyses were conducted both for random-effects model and fixed-effects model.  Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate the  origins of heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's funnel  plots and Egger's test. RESULTS: Six studies encompassing 323 patients with  SLE-associated PAH were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled 1-, 3- and  5-year survival rates were 88% (95% CI, 0.80-0.93), 81% (95% CI, 0.67-0.90) and  68% (95% CI, 0.52-0.80), respectively. No significant publication bias was shown.  WHO Functional class (Fc) III/IV was found to be an independent prognostic factor  of mortality. Higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), higher pulmonary  vascular resistance (PVR), lower six minutes walking distance (6MWD), higher  brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and higher N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) level  were also related to poor survival. CONCLUSION: The long-term survival of  patients with SLE-associated PAH is poor, which is worth paying greater clinical  and academic attention. This study suggested that early diagnosis and management  are recommended in patients with SLE-associated PAH for a better outcome of  survival.

T1  - ANA-Negative Lupus Presenting with Heart Failure and Severe Valvular Dysfunction: 
SP  - 186-8
AB  - Antinuclear antibody (ANA) negative lupus is an important subset of the systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease spectrum. Since the introduction of human cell  line for ANA assay, the occurrence of true ANA-negative SLE has been a rare  clinical phenomenon. The nature of cardiac involvement in ANA-negative SLE is not  well understood, although any cardiac involvement, including valvular  dysfunction, should be considered as a presenting manifestation of SLE  irrespective of serology status. Early recognition and intervention appears to be  associated with decreased morbidity. The following report describes our first  case of ANA-negative SLE with an initial presentation of severe cardiac valvular  dysfunction and heart failure. It also characterizes the spectrum of disease  severity in ANA-negative SLE and demonstrates how aggressive SLE therapy can  improve cardiac disease.

T1  - Challenges in pulmonary hypertension: managing the unexpected.
SP  - 674-81
AB  - The diverse challenges associated with diagnosis and management of patients with  pulmonary hypertension are illustrated in this case-based review. Case 1  describes a patient diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with  right heart failure and active systemic lupus erythematosus who was effectively  treated with an up-front triple combination of PAH therapies and  immunosuppressive therapy. In case 2, a diagnosis of pulmonary veno-occlusive  disease was reached after a combined approach of clinical suspicion, physical  examination, and invasive and noninvasive tests. Cautious PAH therapy and  high-dose diuretics provided clinical benefit in this patient and served as a  bridge to lung transplantation. These cases highlight the need for ongoing  follow-up of patients with PAH, comprising frequent assessment of treatment  success and continued diagnostic evaluation.

T1  - Sustained remission in lupus nephritis: still a hard road ahead.
SP  - 2011-2018
AB  - End-stage renal disease caused by lupus nephritis (LN) is an avoidable outcome  yet there is considerable uncertainty and variability among nephrologists in  their approaches to this disorder. This review discusses recent evidence relevant  to the management of LN including recent consensus statements. Long-term results  are encouraging compared with 30 years ago, but despite the use of the best  available current therapies and achieving high levels of early clinical  responses, the kidney often sustains long-term damage and nephritis relapses  affect over 50%. Major hurdles to management include the complexity of the  clinical presentation, histological features and serological tests, and the  absence of reliable outcome predictors or markers of treatment response. The key  serological and histopathological characteristics relevant to the practising  nephrologist are reviewed, and the limitations of current disease activity  markers discussed. There are many potential biomarkers under evaluation, and a  framework for their validation is presented. Clinical trials of existing or newer  agents for LN have typically been inconclusive and have raised problems of trial  design and interpretation that are a barrier to new drug development. The major  issues affecting clinical trial design and their potential solutions are  summarized.

T1  - From BILAG to BILAG-based combined lupus assessment-30 years on.
SP  - 1357-63
AB  - Disease activity in SLE can be difficult to measure and there is no biomarker  that uniformly reflects disease activity. There are various disease activity  scores, but there is no gold standard assessment tool. This is a review of the  development of the BILAG index from the classic BILAG disease activity index to  the BILAG-2004 disease activity index and composite response criteria. The  original classic BILAG index was revised and distinguished nine organs/systems.  Features that indicated damage, such as avascular necrosis, were excluded. There  was improvement in the glossary, scoring system and software. The BILAG-2004  index has been shown to be reliable, valid and sensitive to change. The  BILAG-2004 index has been modified for pregnancy and has also been used in  paediatrics. The SLE Responder Index (SRI) and the BILAG-based combined lupus  assessment (BICLA) are composite responder indices incorporating the BILAG index.  Since the initial development of the BILAG index in 1984, major improvements have  been made in the measurement of disease activity in lupus. However, the  BILAG-2004 index is the only transitional index that grades clinical features as  being new, the same, worse or improving and incorporates severity in the scoring.

T1  - Lessons Learned From the Clinical Trials of Novel Biologics and Small Molecules 
SP  - 509-20
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a ripe area for drug development. There are  great unmet needs, especially for those with lupus nephritis, in which good  responses occur only in the minority of treated patients. An expanded  understanding of immunopathogenesis of SLE coupled with the availability of  sophisticated bioengineering technologies has resulted in the ability to supply  the lupus community with the reagents needed to perform clinical trials. However,  drug development in SLE has proven to be particularly challenging. Only one drug,  belimumab, has been approved for patients with SLE through the traditional route  of randomized controlled trials. The basis for our failures is unknown, but most  assuredly relates to trial design issues, confounding by background medicines,  and the multiplicity of active biologic pathways in this disease. Off-label use  of failed trial drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil and rituximab paradoxically  has become routine in many parts of the world. Despite the obstacles, there  currently is unprecedented clinical trial activity in lupus nephritis, which most  likely will lead to at least one drug approval in years to come.

T1  - ESKD, Transplantation, and Dialysis in Lupus Nephritis.
SP  - 500-8
AB  - Kidney disease resulting from systemic lupus erythematosus accounts for 1.9% of  the end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) population in the United States. Systemic  lupus erythematosus patients with lupus nephritis (LN) who progress to ESKD in  the United States are mostly female (81%) and of African ancestry (49%), with a  mean age of 41 years at initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). The  incidence of ESKD in patients with LN steadily increased between 1982 and 1998  because RRT was offered more readily to LN patients in the United States.  However, it appears to have plateaued in the early 2000s, and recently decreased,  with approximately 3.26 incident cases per million patient-years during the  biennium period of 2009 to 2010. When LN patients approach ESKD, patients and  providers must choose among the RRT options available. The trend of the RRT used  to support LN ESKD patients is not guided by the lower mortality seen with the  use of kidney transplantation compared with dialysis (>85% versus 73% survival  during 5 years of follow-up evaluation, respectively). Less than 4% of LN ESKD  patients have pre-emptive kidney transplantation. Although the survival of LN  ESKD patients who begin with hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are similar  (77% versus 79% during 3 years of follow-up evaluation, respectively), more than  80% of patients begin with hemodialysis and less than 15% begin with peritoneal  dialysis in the United States.

T1  - Pregnancy and Lupus Nephritis.
SP  - 487-99
AB  - The management of lupus nephritis in pregnancy presents a diagnostic and  therapeutic challenge for providers. Pregnancy creates a series of physiologic  changes in the immune system and kidney that may result in an increased risk of  disease flare and adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, such as preeclampsia,  fetal loss, and preterm delivery. Conception should be delayed until disease is  in remission to ensure the best pregnancy outcomes. Maternal disease activity and  fetal well-being should be monitored closely by an interdisciplinary team,  including obstetricians, rheumatologists, and nephrologists throughout pregnancy.  Careful attention must be paid to the dosing and potential teratogenicity of  medications.

T1  - The Kidney Biopsy in Lupus Nephritis: Past, Present, and Future.
SP  - 465-77
AB  - Since its incorporation into clinical practice in the 1950s, the percutaneous  kidney biopsy has played an important role in advancing our understanding of  lupus nephritis (LN). The biopsy findings have been used to classify and subgroup  LN in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and also to inform treatment  decisions and predict prognosis. Several classifications schemes have been  applied clinically however despite this evolution in histopathologic  classification, our ability to predict treatment response and determine prognosis  remains limited. In this review we will examine the evolving role of the kidney  biopsy in the management of LN, including the potentially larger role the biopsy  could play in the future.

T1  - Optimal Monitoring For Coronary Heart Disease Risk in Patients with Systemic 
SP  - 54-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Premature coronary heart disease (CHD) significantly affects morbidity  and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several studies have  detected factors influencing the atherosclerotic process, as well as methods to  quantify the atherosclerotic burden in subclinical stages. The aim of this  systematic review was to identify the minimum investigations to optimally monitor  CHD risk in SLE. METHODS: English-restricted literature review was performed  using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)  guidelines through Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases, from  inception until May 2014 (Medline until October 2014). Specific search terms  included, among others, "SLE," "atherosclerosis," "CHD," "myocardial ischemia,"  "acute coronary syndrome," "myocardial infarction," and "angina pectoris." We  identified 101 eligible articles, 23 with cardiovascular events (CVE) as  endpoints and 78 with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis. The  Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Certain  traditional and disease-specific factors were identified as independent  predictors for CHD. Among the former were age (particularly postmenopausal  state), male sex, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. Disease  activity and duration, cumulative damage, antiphospholipid antibodies, high  sensitivity C-reactive protein, and renal disease were the most consistent  disease-related factors. Corticosteroids were linked to increased CHD risk  whereas antimalarials were protective. Concerning imaging techniques, carotid  ultrasonography (intima-media thickness and plaque) was shown to independently  predict CVE. CONCLUSION: Premature CHD in SLE is multifactorial; modifiable  variables should be monitored at frequent intervals to ensure prompt management.  Disease-specific factors also affect the atherogenic process and should be  evaluated regularly. Carotid ultrasonography may hold promise in predicting CVE  in selected high-risk patients.

SP  - 301
AB  - Current systemic therapies are rarely curative for patients with severe  life-threatening forms of autoimmune diseases (ADs). During the past 15 years,  autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been demonstrated to cure  some patients with severe AD refractory to all other available therapies. As a  consequence, ADs such as lupus and scleroderma have become an emerging indication  for cell therapy. Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), isolated from bone  marrow and other sites, display specific immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory  properties and appear as ideal tools to treat such diseases. The present update  aims at summarizing recent knowledge acquired in the field of MSC-based therapies  for lupus and scleroderma.

SP  - 73-91
AB  - Cholestatic liver diseases are rare diseases that often lead to cirrhosis and its  consequent complications. In addition to liver-related morbidity, patients with  cholestatic liver diseases often suffer from autoimmune diseases that affect  several organs and tissues. The robust and efficient data collection and  collaboration between hepatologists and rheumatologists have led to significant  advancements in understanding the relationship between the cholestatic liver  diseases and associated autoimmune diseases. In this paper, we discuss the  cholestatic liver diseases (primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing  cholangitis and immunoglobulin G4 associated cholangitis) and associated  autoimmune diseases.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: an update.
SP  - 1-13
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is an inflammatory condition of the kidneys that encompasses  various patterns of renal disease including glomerular and tubulointerstitial  pathology. It is a major predictor of poor prognosis in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). Genetic factors, including several predisposing loci,  and environmental factors, such as EBV and ultraviolet light, have been  implicated in the pathogenesis. It carries a high morbidity and mortality if left  untreated. Renal biopsy findings are utilized to guide treatment. Optimizing risk  factors such as proteinuria and hypertension with renin-angiotensin receptor  blockade is crucial. Immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for patients with  focal or diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis (Class III or IV) disease, and  certain patients with membranous LN (Class V) disease. Over the past decade,  immunosuppressive therapies have significantly improved long-term outcomes, but  the optimal therapy for LN remains to be elucidated. Cyclophosphamide-based  regimens, given concomitantly with corticosteroids, have improved survival  significantly. Even though many patients achieve remission, the risk of relapse  remains considerably high. Other treatments include hydroxychloroquine,  mycofenolate mofetil, and biologic therapies such as Belimumab, Rituximab, and  Abatacept. In this paper, we provide a review of LN, including pathogenesis,  classification, and clinical manifestations. We will focus, though, on discussion  of the established as well as emerging therapies for patients with proliferative  and membranous lupus nephritis.

T1  - The efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in altering pregnancy outcome in women with 
SP  - 285-90
AB  - The use of low-dose aspirin and heparinoids has improved the pregnancy outcome in  obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However, current treatment fails in  20-30% of APS pregnancies, raising the need to explore other treatments to  improve obstetrical outcome. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used in patients  with autoimmune diseases, mainly systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), due to its  anti-inflammatory, anti-aggregant and immune-regulatory properties. Evidence from  in vitro and animal models suggests a potential protective effect of HCQ in  obstetric APS. Pending the availability of prospective trials, we aimed to  systematically review the available evidence and to assess the clinical judgment  of a panel of experts regarding the use of HCQ in improving pregnancy outcome in  women with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Clinical data on the ability of HCQ  to improve pregnancy outcome in women with aPL are very limited in the available  literature. Only one cohort study evaluating maternal and fetal outcome of  pregnancy in patients with SLE who were exposed to HCQ was identified. Four of 14  (29%) treated with HCQ patients had pregnancy failure, compared with six of 24  (25%) of patients not treated with HCQ. However, the effect of HCQ was not  adjusted for the use of other medications such as aspirin, heparins or steroids.  Selected experts were contacted by e-mail and asked to review the summary of the  evidence provided by the working group and to briefly answer each of the proposed  questions. Overall, the panel of experts agreed that adding HCQ could be  considered in selected cases or after failure of standard treatment with aspirin  and a heparin agent. Specifically, the majority of experts considered adding HCQ  in specific scenarios, such as women with previous thrombosis (either arterial  and/or venous), and/or with previous ischaemic placenta-mediated complications.  Prospective studies are necessary before the use of HCQ during pregnancy in women  with aPL should be routinely recommended for clinical practice.

T1  - The incidence and prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus in Thrace, 
SP  - 102-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We estimated the prevalence and incidence, clinical features,  treatment, and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients in the  Thrace region of Turkey. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 331 patients (307  female, 24 male, mean age 38.5 years) diagnosed with SLE between 2003 and 2014.  Clinical features, treatments, and response to various treatment modalities were  recorded. Our hospital has been the only tertiary referral center for  rheumatological diseases for a mixed rural and urban population of 620,477 people  (306,036 females, 314,411 males) for more than 16 years. RESULTS: The mean annual  incidence of SLE was 4.44/100,000 (females, 8.4/100,000; males, 0.6/100,000). The  overall prevalence of SLE was 51.7/100,000 (females, 97.7/100,000; males,  7/100,000). Major organ involvement was present in the following percentages:  neurologic involvement: 20.1%; renal involvement: 28.2%; autoimmune hemolytic  anemia: 9.6%; thrombocytopenia: 14.7%. Seventeen SLE patients (13 females, four  males) died at a median follow-up of 48 months. The five-year survival was 94.5%,  and the ten-year survival was 89.9%. According to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis,  poor prognostic factors were: male gender (p = 0.015); smoking (p = 0.02);  pleural involvement (p = 0.011); thrombocytopenia (p = 0.021); myocarditis (p =  0.028); renal involvement (p = 0.037); treatment with cyclophosphamide (p =  0.011); and an initial high SLEDAI score (>4) (p = 0.02). Lymphopenia at the time  of diagnosis appeared as a favorable prognostic factor (p = 0.008). Cox  regression analysis revealed myocarditis (OR: 20.4, p = 0.018) and age at  diagnosis (OR: 1.11, p = 0.035) to be poor, and lymphopenia at the time of  diagnosis to be good prognostic factors (OR:0.13, p = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: The  annual incidence and prevalence of SLE in the Thrace region of Turkey is lower  than those reported in North America, however they are similar to those reported  for European countries. Clinical manifestations appear to be milder, whereas  survival was similar to those recorded in Western countries.

T1  - Optic nerve involvement in childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus: Three 
SP  - 93-6
AB  - The ocular system can be affected in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in one  third of patients. However, optic nerve involvement is relatively uncommon, but  is more so in pediatric SLE patients, where it can occur in 1% of cases. We  report three children with SLE who presented with optic nerve involvement. Two  children had optic neuritis, with optic neuritis being the first manifestation in  one child. The third child had ischaemic optic neuropathy secondary to  antiphospholipid syndrome. A careful work up for SLE should be performed in every  child with optic nerve disease. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment results in a  better prognosis.

T1  - Identification of Candidate Predictors of Lupus Flare.
SP  - 184-96
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus, the prototype systemic autoimmune disease, is  characterized by extensive self-reactivity, inflammation, and organ system  damage. Sustained production of type I interferon is seen in many patients and  contributes to immune dysregulation. Disease activity fluctuates with periods of  relative quiescence or effective management by immunosuppressive drugs, followed  by disease flares. Tissue damage accumulates over time, with kidneys and  cardiovascular system particularly affected. Identification of the underlying  molecular mechanisms that precede clinical exacerbations, allowing prediction of  future flare, could lead to therapeutic interventions that prevent severe  disease. We generated gene expression data from a longitudinal cohort of lupus  patients, some showing at least one period of severe flare and others with  relatively stable disease over the period of study. Candidate predictors of  future clinical flare were identified based on analysis of differentially  expressed gene transcripts between the flare and non-flare groups at a time when  all patients had relatively quiescent clinical disease activity. Our results  suggest the hypothesis that altered regulation of genome stability and nucleic  acid fidelity may be important molecular precursors of future clinical flare,  generating endogenous nucleic acid triggers that engage intracellular mechanisms  that mimic a chronic host response to viral infection.

T1  - [Overcoming disease in systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 591-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory  autoimmune disease affecting a broad range of different organ systems and, hence,  presenting with multiple symptomatic domains, which considerably reduces the  quality of life of patients. Within the last decade the prognosis of the disease  has been significantly improved by novel therapies and intensive monitoring;  however, non-pharmaceutical strategies for symptom control, self-efficacy and  coping abilities for those affected are still insufficiently established.  OBJECTIVE: This article describes the possibilities and limitations of  non-pharmaceutical strategies and makes suggestions for future treatment and  research. RESULTS: Preliminary interventional studies using psychoeducational,  psychosocial and behavioral psychotherapeutic approaches, have consistently shown  that the needs and expectations of patients related to help and support by  doctors and professional care can be adequately and sustainably met. In addition,  coping abilities and the quality of life can be increased.

T1  - Description of 214 cases of autoimmune congenital heart block: Results of the 
SP  - 1154-60
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac neonatal lupus syndrome is due to anti-SSA or SSB antibodies  and mainly includes congenital heart block (CHB) and dilated cardiomyopathy  (DCM). Its optimal management is still debated. We report a large series of  autoimmune high degree CHB. METHODS: Inclusion criteria in this retrospective  study were fetuses or neonates with high-degree CHB associated with maternal  anti-SSA/SSB antibodies. RESULTS: 214 CHB were included: 202 detected in utero at  a median term of 23 weeks' gestation (WG) [range 16 to 39 WG] and 12 neonatal  cases diagnosed at a median age of 0 days [range birth to 8 days]. The 214 cases  of CHB included 202 (94.4%) third-degree CHB, 8 (3.7%) second-degree CHB, and 4  (1.9%) intermittent CHB. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with  feto-neonatal deaths (15.7%) were hydrops (p<0.001; hazard ratio [HR] 12.4 [95%  confidence interval (95%CI) 4.7-32.7]) and prematurity (p=0.002; HR 17.1 [95%CI  2.8-103.1]). During a median follow-up of 7 years [birth to 36 years], 148 of 187  children born alive (79.1%) had a pacemaker, 35 (18.8%, one missing data) had  DCM, and 22 (11.8%) died. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with child  death were in utero DCM (p=0.0157; HR 6.37 [95%CI: 1.25-32.44]), postnatal DCM  (p<0.0001; HR 227.58[95%CI: 24.33-2128.46]) and pacemaker implantation (p=0.0035;  HR 0.11[95%CI: 0.02-0.51]). The use of fluorinated steroids was neither  associated with survival nor with regression of 2nd degree CHB. CONCLUSION: In  this second largest series of CHB, we confirm some of the previous results. We  were unable to find data supporting the routine use of in utero fluorinated  steroids.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus: an update on treat-to-target.
SP  - 22-8
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus involves many organ systems, and its vague and  multisystem manifestations make early diagnosis and treatment difficult. However,  early diagnosis and treatment offer the best chance of reducing end-organ damage  and achieving remission. This article describes a new strategy called  treat-to-target that may help patients achieve remission.

T1  - Therapy and pharmacological properties of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in 
SP  - 231-69
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This review examines the pharmacokinetics, modes of action and  therapeutic properties of the anti-malarial drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and  chloroquine (CQ), in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and related conditions, as well as osteoarthritis (OA).  KEY FINDINGS: Both HCQ and CQ have historically been employed successfully for  the treatment of SLE and RA for over 70 years. HCQ has been used extensively for  SLE where it has a good reputation for controlling the dermatological  complications in SLE. It has also been reported to effectively control the  symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome, as well as preventing thrombosis in phospholipid  antibody (aPL) syndrome. In RA and SLE, HCQ is preferred because of the lower  incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared with CQ and it might  have a lower risk of ocular adverse reactions. There is increasing evidence that  HCQ may reduce atherosclerosis and risks of cardiovascular disease in rheumatic  patients. Both HCQ and CQ have been shown to improve glycaemia and reduce the  risks of type II diabetes mellitus. Although both HCQ and CQ are effective in  low-moderate RA, HCQ is now preferred as part of combination therapy for more  severe disease. The advantages of combination therapy are that the doses of the  individual drugs may be lowered so reducing adverse reactions. Both HCQ and CQ  are diastereoisomers, have basic properties and are given as the sulphate and  phosphate salts. While being relatively well absorbed orally and with good  bioavailability, they have long and variable plasma terminal elimination  half-lives (approximately 40-60 days). This reflects their high volume of  distribution, V D (HCQ 44,000L; CQ 65,000L) which extends into aqueous  compartments, long mean residence time (HCQ 1300 h; CQ 900 h) and with about half  the drugs (metabolites) undergoing renal clearance. The strong binding to melanin  reflects the ocular injury and dermatological properties of these drugs. The  consensus is that the occurrence of ocular adverse reactions can be minimised by  close attention to the dose (which should be set on a body weight basis) with  regular (e.g. quarterly) retinal examination. Although HCQ and CQ can pass  through the placenta, the use of these drugs during pregnancy does not appear to  risk harm to the baby and might be beneficial to the mother with SLE and her  child by controlling the SLE disease activity, which is known to be an important  factor affecting pregnancy outcome. The modes of action of HCQ and CQ in these  arthritides represent somewhat of an enigma. Undoubtedly, these drugs have  multiple actions related, in part, their ability to accumulate in lysosomes and  autophagosomes of phagocytic cells as well as affecting MHC Class II expression  and antigen presentation; actions of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  [e.g. interleukin-1 (IL-1) tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)]; control of toll-like  receptor-9 activation; and leucocyte generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS);  i.e. antioxidant activity. The actions of these drugs on T and B cells are less  clear but may depend on these leucocyte-mediated actions. Anti-malarials also  protect against cytokine-mediated cartilage resorption. This and other actions  may underlie the potential benefits in treating OA. The exact relationships of  these various actions, mostly determined in vitro, have not been specifically  defined in vivo or ex vivo in relation to clinical efficacy. OUTCOMES: HCQ and CQ  have a good reputation for being effective and relatively safe treatments in SLE,  mild-moderate RA and Sjogren's syndrome. There is need for (a) more information  on their mode of action in relation to the control of these diseases, (b) scope  for developing formulations that have improved pharmacokinetic and therapeutic  properties and safety, and (c) further exploring their use in drug combinations  not only with other disease modifying agents but also with biologics.

T1  - Effectiveness of Nonpharmacologic Interventions for Decreasing Fatigue in Adults 
SP  - 141-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has  significantly improved over the past decades. As SLE patients live longer they  inevitably experience a range of clinical manifestations and somatic symptoms.  Quality of life may also be impacted through a range of subjective indicators.  Among these parameters, fatigue is the most prevalent complaint. Nonpharmacologic  strategies seem regularly utilized for fatigue management in SLE; however, their  real effects are not known. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to analyze  the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic interventions to reduce fatigue in SLE  patients. Medline/PreMedline, Embase, PsycINFO, SCI-EXPANDED, Social Sciences  Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library were searched (June 2014). Studies were  included and assessed for quality if they fulfilled prespecified criteria.  RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were finally included (n = 549): 7 randomized  trials, 1 nonrandomized trial, and 4 prospective observational studies. They  assessed 5 main intervention categories: exercise, behavioral and psychological  approaches, diets, acupuncture, and phototherapy. All interventions produced  reductions in fatigue, as measured using at least 1 instrument. Aerobic exercise  was found to be effective and suitable for reducing fatigue, but results were not  always consistent across instruments used. The diversity of psychological  interventions limits the significance of the results; however, data point to a  positive impact on fatigue. There are still few data on the effect of  acupuncture, diets, and ultraviolet A radiation. CONCLUSION: Studies are few and  heterogeneous; however, nonpharmacologic interventions applied to SLE patients  can be effective in reducing fatigue.

T1  - Is B Cell-Targeted Therapy Effective in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?
SP  - 98-103
AB  - In the past decade we have witnessed a dramatic change in the management of  autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, due to the development of new  biologic drugs designed to target key mediators in the autoimmune process.  However, the development of similar target-specific drugs for the management of  SLE has not been as successful. The B cell has long been considered central to  the pathogenesis of SLE and has been regarded as an important target for biologic  drugs. Several B cell-targeted drugs have been developed and although the  mechanisms seem promising, most of the studies published to date have failed to  achieve their primary endpoints, leading to an ongoing debate regarding the role  of B cell therapy in SLE. The present report discusses the pros and cons of B  cell-targeted therapy in SLE, reviews the clinical studies, and offers possible  explanations forthe discrepancies between randomized control studies and  real-life experience.

T1  - Epigenetics and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Unmet Needs.
SP  - 367-76
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic relapsing-remitting autoimmune  disease affecting several organs. Although the management of lupus patients has  improved in the last years, several aspects still remain challenging. More  sensitive and specific biomarkers for an early diagnosis as well as for  monitoring disease activity and tissue damage are needed. Genome-wide association  and gene mapping studies have supported the genetic background for SLE  susceptibility. However, the relatively modest risk association and the studies  in twins have suggested a role for environmental and epigenetic factors, as well  as genetic-epigenetic interaction. Accordingly, there is evidence that  differences in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNA profiling can be  found in lupus patients versus normal subjects. Moreover, impaired DNA  methylation on the inactive X-chromosome was suggested to explain, at least in  part, the female prevalence of the disease. Epigenetic markers may be help in  fulfilling the unmet needs for SLE by offering new diagnostic tools, new  biomarkers for monitoring disease activity, or to better characterize patients  with a silent clinical disease but with an active serology. Anti-DNA,  anti-phospholipid, and anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies are thought to be pathogenic  for glomerulonephritis, recurrent thrombosis and miscarriages, and neonatal  lupus, respectively. However, tissue damage occurs occasionally or, in some  patients, only in spite of the persistent presence of the antibodies. Preliminary  studies suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may explain why the damage takes place  in some patients only or at a given time.

T1  - The Diagnosis and Treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
SP  - 423-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a  prevalence of 36.7/100 000 in Germany and a female/male ratio of 4:1. The  clinical course is variable, with a broad spectrum of organ manifestations; lupus  nephritis develops in about half of all patients. METHODS: This review is based  on a selective search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library, including current  guidelines and expert recommendations. RESULTS: Assessment of clinical symptoms,  laboratory findings, and optional biopsy results are the basis for early  diagnosis of SLE. All patients should be treated with antimalarials as soon as  the diagnosis is confirmed. In particular, hydroxychloroquine is associated with  a higher rate of remission, fewer relapses, and reduced damage in the course of  the disease, even in lupus nephritis. High-dose glucocorticoids should be given  only when acutely indicated; immunosuppressives such as azathioprine,  methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil may be administered to reduce  glucocorticoids, according to the EULAR recommendations. Belimumab was recently  approved as add-on therapy in autoantibody-positive SLE patients with high  disease activity unresponsive to standard treatment. Short-term induction pulse  therapy with low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide, as well as continued  mycophenolate mofetil treatment are advances in lupus nephritis. CONCLUSION: The  long-term prognosis for SLE has improved markedly in recent decades because of  earlier diagnosis and optimized treatment. Further research and randomized  controlled trials are needed for the development of specifically targeted  therapies.

T1  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus: a review of 123 cases in China.
SP  - 761-7
AB  - AIM: To analyze the clinical features, outcomes and prognosis of neonatal lupus  erythematosus (NLE) in China. METHOD: We reviewed 12 NLE cases at the Peking  Union Medical College Hospital and compared the data with 111 cases reported in  China between 1990 and 2014. The Chinese medical journal search engines used in  this study were Wanfang.data and Science China. RESULTS: No gender dominance in  NLE incidence was found. Cutaneous lesions were present in more than 96% of  patients, while cardiac, hematological and hepatobiliary manifestations were seen  in 12.61%, 45.53% and 17.89% of cases, respectively. Congenital heart block (CHB)  tended to be more persistent, with two cases showing CHB for 1 year and three  cases persisting for 7-10 years. In this study more than 90% of mothers were  anti-Sjogren's syndrome A positive, and 65.04% were asymptomatic prior to the  pregnancy. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that clinicians, especially  dermatologists, in China should improve their recognition of this disease to  avoid misdiagnosis, and more attention should be paid to the follow-up of NLE  patients and their asymptomatic mothers.

T1  - Genetics and novel aspects of therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1005-18
AB  - Autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune  hepatitis and inflammatory bowel disease, have complex pathogeneses and the  factors which cause these disorders are not well understood. But all have in  common that they arise from a dysfunction of the immune system, interpreting self  components as foreign antigens. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of  these complex inflammatory disorders that mainly affects women and can lead to  inflammation and severe damage of virtually any tissue and organ. Recently, the  application of advanced techniques of genome-wide scanning revealed more genetic  information about SLE than previously possible. These case-control or  family-based studies have provided evidence that SLE susceptibility is based  (with a few exceptions) on an individual accumulation of various risk alleles  triggered by environmental factors and also help to explain the discrepancies in  SLE susceptibility between different populations or ethnicities. Moreover, during  the past years new therapies (autologous stem cell transplantation, B cell  depletion) and improved conventional treatment options (corticosteroids,  traditional and new immune-suppressants like mycophenolate mofetile) changed the  perspective in SLE therapeutic approaches. Thus, this article reviews genetic  aspects of this autoimmune disease, summarizes clinical aspects of SLE and  provides a general overview of conventional and new therapeutic approaches in  SLE.

T1  - Case of plasmablastic lymphoma of the sigmoid colon and literature review.
SP  - 7598-603
AB  - Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is  associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although PBL is  most commonly observed in the oral cavity of HIV-positive patients, it can also  be observed at extra-oral sites in HIV-negative patients. This report represents  an unusual case of HIV-negative PBL that occurred in the sigmoid colon. This  patient had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and an underlying  immunosuppressive state from long term steroid therapy. The lymphoma cells were  positive for CD138, kappa light chain restriction and Epstein-Barr virus and  negative for CD20/L26, CD3, CD79a, UCHL1 (CD45RO) and cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). The  patient died approximately 2 mo after the operation. In the present paper, we  review cases of PBL of the colon in HIV-negative patients.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multiorgan autoimmune disease with a highly  variable clinical course, typically involving women in childbearing age. At  present, many aspects of its pathogenesis still remain unclear. Moreover,  although a significant increase of patient survival has been observed in the last  decades, morbidity and mortality remain high. Finally, SLE impacts negatively on  the health-related quality-of-life of patients. Therefore, multiple aspects of  SLE still remain challenging and it continues to be the object of both clinical  and translational clinical research. Herewith, we provide a critical digest of  the recent literature on this topic.

SP  - 1300-10
AB  - Drug-induced autoimmune disease was initially described decades ago, with reports  of vasculitis and a lupus-like syndrome in patients taking hydralazine,  procainamide, and sulfadiazine. Over the years, multiple other agents have been  linked to immune-mediated glomerular disease, often with associated autoantibody  formation. Certain clinical and laboratory features may distinguish these  entities from their idiopathic counterparts, and making this distinction is  important in the diagnosis and management of these patients. Here, drug-induced,  ANCA-associated vasculitis, drug-induced lupus, and drug-associated membranous  nephropathy are reviewed.

T1  - Immunosuppressive Therapies for the Maintenance Treatment of Proliferative Lupus 
SP  - 1392-400
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the most effective immunosuppressive therapy for the  longterm management of proliferative lupus nephritis (PLN) based on the outcome  of renal failure. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials  (RCT) was conducted. MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. RCT designed to examine  the maintenance treatment effectiveness of immunosuppressive agents for PLN were  included. A Bayesian network metaanalysis of 2-arm and 3-arm trials was used. A  skeptical prior assumption was used in sensitivity analysis. Four  immunosuppressive agents were evaluated: cyclophosphamide (CYC), azathioprine  (AZA), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone alone. The outcome of interest  was renal failure during the study period, defined by serum creatinine (sCr) >  256 micromol/l, doubling of sCr from baseline, and/or endstage renal disease.  RESULTS: The OR (95% credible interval) of developing renal failure at 2-3 years  was 0.72 (0.11, 4.49) for AZA versus CYC, 0.32 (0.04, 2.25) for MMF versus CYC,  2.40 (0.22, 36.94) for prednisone alone versus CYC, and 0.45 (0.11, 1.48) for MMF  versus AZA. The probability (95% credible interval) of developing renal failure  at 2 years as expected for each agent was 6% (0.7%, 24%) for MMF, 12% (2%, 37%)  for AZA, 16% (5%, 33%) for CYC, and 31% (5%, 81%) for prednisone alone. After  applying a skeptical prior in the Bayesian analysis, there was no evidence of  benefit for 1 therapy over another. CONCLUSION: Although the data suggest that  MMF may be superior to other treatments for the maintenance treatment of PLN, the  evidence is not conclusive.

T1  - Autoimmune diseases and pregnancy: analysis of a series of cases.
SP  - 216
AB  - BACKGROUND: An autoimmune disease is characterized by tissue damage, caused by  self-reactivity of different effector mechanisms of the immune system, namely  antibodies and T cells. All autoimmune diseases, to some extent, have  implications for fertility and obstetrics. Currently, due to available treatments  and specialised care for pregnant women with autoimmune disease, the prognosis  for both mother and child has improved significantly. However these pregnancies  are always high risk. The purpose of this study is to analyse the  fertility/pregnancy process of women with systemic and organ-specific autoimmune  diseases and assess pathological and treatment implications. METHODS: The authors  performed an analysis of the clinical records and relevant obstetric history of  five patients representing five distinct autoimmune pathological scenarios,  selected from Autoimmune Disease Consultation at the Hospital of Braga, and  reviewed the literature. RESULTS: The five clinical cases are the following: Case  1-28 years old with systemic lupus erythematosus, and clinical remission of the  disease, under medication with hydroxychloroquine, prednisolone and  acetylsalicylic acid, with incomplete miscarriage at 7 weeks of gestation without  signs of thrombosis. Case 2-44 years old with history of two late miscarriages, a  single preterm delivery (33 weeks) and multiple thrombotic events over the years,  was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome after acute myocardial infarction.  Case 3-31 years old with polymyositis, treated with azathioprine for 3 years with  complete remission of the disease, took the informed decision to get pregnant  after medical consultation and full weaning from azathioprine, and gave birth to  a healthy term new-born. Case 4-38 years old pregnant woman developed Behcet's  syndrome during the final 15 weeks of gestation and with disease exacerbation  after delivery. Case 5-36 years old with autoimmune thyroiditis diagnosed during  her first pregnancy, with difficult control over the thyroid function over the  years and first trimester miscarriage, suffered a second miscarriage despite  clinical stability and antibody regression. CONCLUSIONS: As described in  literature, the authors found a strong association between autoimmune disease and  obstetric complications, especially with systemic lupus erythematosus,  antiphospholipid syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis.

T1  - Pattern recognition receptors as potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory 
SP  - 122
AB  - The pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system are part of the  first line of defence against pathogens. However, they also have the ability to  respond to danger signals that are frequently elevated during tissue damage and  at sites of inflammation. Inadvertent activation of pattern recognition receptors  has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of many conditions including  inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Prolonged inflammation most often results in  pain and damage to tissues. In particular, the Toll-like receptors and  nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptors that form inflammasomes  have been postulated as key contributors to the inflammation observed in  rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout and systemic lupus erythematosus. As  such, there is increasing interest in targeting these receptors for therapeutic  treatment in the clinic. Here the role of pattern recognition receptors in the  pathogenesis of these diseases is discussed, with an update on the development of  interventions to modulate the activity of these potential therapeutic targets.

SP  - 837-48
AB  - Lupus nephritis is one of the most common severe manifestations of systemic lupus  erythematosus and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Genetic, ethnic and hormonal factors may influence the presence and severity of  renal involvement and therefore affect the outcome and overall prognosis of  patients. In this review, we will discuss the association of known lupus risk  factors in developing renal disease and explore the recent literature to identify  potential risk factors and their clinical implications in terms of diagnostic  vigilance, management and prognosis.

T1  - Electroconvulsive therapy as a treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric lupus 
SP  - 1327-31
AB  - Neuropsychiatric disorders associated with systemic lupus erythematosus are very  common. Treatment generally consists of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive  therapy; however, some cases are unresponsive. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is  a recognized treatment modality in psychiatry and is an option for refractory  cases of neuropsychiatric lupus. This report describes three cases of  neuropsychiatric lupus that improved with ECT after failure of antipsychotics and  immunosuppressive therapy. All cases met DSM-5 criteria for catatonia (case 1:  agitation, stereotypies, and grimacing; case 2: stupor, mutism, and grimacing;  case 3: agitation, mutism, and stereotypies); therefore, ECT was indicated. This  case series shows that ECT can be a therapeutic option in patients with  neuropsychiatric lupus, especially when associated with catatonia and  unresponsive to conventional treatment.

T1  - Association of lymphotoxin alpha polymorphism with systemic lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 398-407
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of eligible studies to  derive precise estimation of the associations of lymphotoxin alpha (LTA) 252 A>G  polymorphism (rs909253) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) risk. METHOD: Data were collected from the following electronic  databases, including EMBASE, PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure  (CNKI). A total of 19 studies (13 studies involving 1346 SLE patients and 1951  controls, six studies involving 1079 RA patients and 1057 controls) were  included. RESULTS: This meta-analysis showed no evidence of significant  association of the A allele with SLE susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] 1.26; 95%  confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.62, P = 0.073), but it showed a weaker  association under an additive model (OR 1.63, 95%CI 1.01-2.65, P = 0.047).  Stratification by ethnicity indicated that the variant A allele carriers  increased the risk of SLE in Asians (OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.44-2.53, P < 0.001).  However, we failed to reveal any association between LTA gene 252 A>G  polymorphism and RA risk under all models (for A vs. G: OR 1.02, 95%CI 0.79-1.33,  P = 0.853; for AA + AG vs. GG: OR 0.86, 95%CI 0.52-1.41, P = 0.542; for AA vs. AG  + GG: OR 1.19, 95%CI 0.80-1.78, P = 0.394, for AA vs. GG: OR 1.03, 95%CI  0.58-1.84, P = 0.919). Similar results were obtained in the subgroup analysis  based on ethnicity. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that LTA 252 A>G  polymorphism is associated with SLE susceptibility in Asians, and there is no  significant association between LTA 252 A>G polymorphism and RA.

T1  - Long-term survival and death causes of systemic lupus erythematosus in China: a 
SP  - e794
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with an  increased risk of death compared to general population. Although previous studies  showed improvement in survival of SLE, the long-term prognosis has not been  elaborated in China.This study aims to integrate the observational studies  estimating current long-term survival of Chinese SLE patients and analyze the  death-cause situation of SLE in China.The study is a systemic review of English  and non-English articles using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, WANFANG, and SINOMED  databases. Additional studies were found by consultation with clinical experts,  browse of references in selected papers, and search of related textbooks. Our  major search terms were SLE, follow-up, prognosis, survival, mortality, and  China.We included cohort studies for survival analysis, and both cohort studies  and case series for death-cause analysis in China.The extraction of the articles  were done by 2 authors independently using predesigned charts, including  characteristics of study, clinical data, analyzing data, and study quality  indicators.All pooled analyses were conducted both for random-effects model and  fixed-effects model. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests were applied to  check potential publication bias. Heterogeneity was tested by sensitivity  analysis. We identified 5 studies for survival analysis comprising 4469 Chinese  patients with SLE (380 observed deaths). Thirty-six studies were suitable for  death-cause analysis with 2179 observed deaths (derived from more than 20,000  Chinese patients with SLE). The overall pooled survival rates for SLE in China  were 94% for 5-year survival rate and 89% for 10-year survival rate after disease  onset from the year 1995 to 2013, which were similar with previous publications  in Asia-Pacific area. The proportions of different causes of death showed  infection (33.2%), renal involvement (18.7%), lupus encephalopathy (13.8%), and  cardiovascular disease (11.5%) as the top 4 causes.The overall survival rates for  Chinese patients with SLE resembled previous publications in Asia-Pacific area.  But the death causes of SLE in China were of some differences indicating  relatively higher proportion of infection and lupus encephalopathy and lower  cardiovascular disease. Ethnicity and more aggressive treatment might have  contributed to the difference in death composition.

T1  - Comparison and evaluation of lupus nephritis response criteria in lupus activity 
SP  - 110
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with diverse  manifestations. Although the approval of new therapies includes only one agent in  50 years, a number of promising new drugs are in development. Lupus nephritis is  a dreaded complication of SLE as it is associated with significant morbidity and  mortality. Advancing the treatment of lupus nephritis requires well-designed  clinical trials and this can be challenging in SLE. The major obstacles involve  identifying the correct population of patients to enroll and ensuring that a  clinically appropriate and patient-centered endpoint is being measured. In this  review, we will first discuss the clinical utility of endpoints chosen to  represent lupus nephritis in global disease activity scales. Second, we will  review completed and active trials focused on lupus nephritis and discuss the  endpoints chosen. There are many important lessons to be learned from existing  assessment tools and clinical trials. Reviewing these points will help ensure  that future efforts will yield meaningful disease activity measures and  well-designed clinical trials to advance our understanding of lupus management.

T1  - Primary disease recurrence-effects on paediatric renal transplantation outcomes.
SP  - 371-84
AB  - Primary disease recurrence after renal transplantation is mainly diagnosed by  examination of biopsy samples, but can also be associated with clinical symptoms.  In some patients, recurrence can lead to graft loss (7-8% of all graft losses).  Primary disease recurrence is generally associated with a high risk of graft loss  in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous proliferative  glomerulonephritis, primary hyperoxaluria or atypical haemolytic uraemic  syndrome. By contrast, disease recurrence is associated with a limited risk of  graft loss in patients with IgA nephropathy, renal involvement associated with  Henoch-Schonlein purpura, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated  glomerulonephritis or lupus nephritis. The presence of systemic diseases that  affect the kidneys, such as sickle cell anaemia and diabetes mellitus, also  increases the risk of delayed graft loss. This Review provides an overview of the  epidemiology, pathophysiology and management of primary disease recurrence in  paediatric renal graft recipients, and describes the overall effect on graft  survival of each of the primary diseases listed above. With appropriate  management, few paediatric patients should be excluded from renal transplantation  programmes because of an increased risk of recurrence.

T1  - Pregnancies in women receiving renal transplant for lupus nephritis: description 
SP  - 1210-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data are available on pregnancy in renal transplanted women for  lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: Among 38 women with LN who received a renal  transplant in our Unit, three had nine pregnancies. During the pregnancies,  patients were followed by a multidisciplinary team including gynecologists and  nephrologists. RESULTS: Two patients received a living related and one a deceased  kidney transplant. The immunosuppressive therapy consisted of steroids calcinurin  inhibithors and mycophenolate mofetil. The last drug was substituted with  azathioprine in prevision of pregnancy. All patients had normal renal function  and urinalysis. In two patients some signs of immunological activity persisted  after transplantation. Five pregnancies ended in miscarriage and four in live  births. Two pregnancies were uneventful. Pre-eclampsia occurred in a hypertensive  patient in two pregnancies that ended in preterm delivery in one case and in a  small for gestation age in both cases. And finally, follow-up graft function and  urinalysis continued to be normal in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: After renal  transplantation our LN women continue to have frequent miscarriages. The other  pregnancies ended in live births and, with the exception of pre-eclampsia in a  hypertensive patient, no renal or extra-renal complications occurred during or  after pregnancy, even in cases with active immunological tests.

T1  - High-Dose Corticosteroid Use and Risk of Hip Osteonecrosis: Meta-Analysis and 
SP  - 1506-1512.e5
AB  - The effect of varying corticosteroid regimens on hip osteonecrosis incidence  remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis and systematic literature review to  determine osteonecrosis occurrences in patients taking corticosteroids at varying  mean and cumulative doses and treatment durations, and whether medical diagnoses  affected osteonecrosis incidence. Fifty-seven studies (23,561 patients) were  reviewed. Regression analysis determined significance between corticosteroid  usage and osteonecrosis incidence. Osteonecrosis incidence was 6.7% with  corticosteroid treatment of >2 g (prednisone-equivalent). Systemic lupus  erythematosus patients had positive correlations between dose and osteonecrosis  incidence. Each 10 mg/d increase was associated with a 3.6% increase in  osteonecrosis rate, and >20 mg/d resulted in a higher osteonecrosis incidence.  Clinicians must be wary of osteonecrosis in patients on high corticosteroid  regimens, particularly in systematic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - Biologic therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 146-53
AB  - Significant progress has been made in the development of therapies for systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). These include agents which target interferons,  cytokines, T lymphocytes and co-stimulatory molecules, B-lymphocytes and B  stimulatory molecules. The latter are of special interest having the most robust  efficacy data to date, ranging from clinical experience to clinical trials, with  belimumab as the first Food and Drug Administration-approved biologic for the  treatment of SLE. Given the wide disease heterogeneity, certain issues like  clinical trial design and pharmacogenomics will continue to challenge drug  development in SLE, there will always be a growing and compelling need for more  of these drugs in order to alleviate the burden of illness in lupus patients.

T1  - Optimizing the use of existing therapies in lupus.
SP  - 129-37
AB  - The management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is complicated by  heterogeneous clinical presentations, a lack of universally accepted tools for  the measurement of disease activity and a lack of powerful, safe, specific  targeted therapies. Current medical treatment of disease activity relies on  glucocorticoids as well as agents including hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) azathioprine (AZA), and less frequently  cyclophosphamide. These agents are generally used in fixed, weight-based dosing  regimens, and both incomplete response and adverse effects are common. An  emerging literature in SLE and other inflammatory diseases in which these drugs  are used suggests that improved patient outcomes could be achieved through a  different approach to their use. Measurement of drug or metabolite concentrations  has been shown in a number of studies to identify under- and over-dosing, predict  efficacy and detect non-adherence to therapy, with positive associations between  optimum drug or metabolite levels and improved outcomes. In this paper, we will  review the literature regarding the measurement of HCQ, MMF, AZA and  cyclophosphamide drug and metabolite levels in SLE and inflammatory disease, and  make recommendations for future research that could facilitate improved outcomes  for patients with SLE.

T1  - Asian lupus in a multi-ethnic society: what can be learnt?
SP  - 113-6
AB  - Ethnic differences in systemic lupus erythematosus account for part of the  variability in disease susceptibility and expression observed in patients. By  studying these racial dissimilarities in a multi-ethnic society, it allows us  greater understanding of disease epidemiology, natural history and pathogenesis  affected by ethnicity. Disease outcomes and the effects on disability and quality  of life have not been well studied in Asian lupus. Ethnic difference in patient  perceptions of disease and treatment could also play a large role in adherence  and ultimately disease outcome. Future studies that explore these areas may shed  insight into better ways either to use existing treatment regimes or to measure  efficacy of new therapies in lupus patients. Given the increased susceptibility  and more severe disease manifestations, the Asia-Pacific region is well placed in  studying disease outcomes and effects of novel therapies.

SP  - 206-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the immunopathogenesis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) has paved the way for new specific immune interventions for  this inflammatory disease similar to those for rheumatoid arthritis and  spondylarthritides. METHODS: New biologics were developed on this basis or are in  the process of clinical development and open up new therapy options for patients.  In this context belimumab is of particular importance. As an innovative biologic  the monoclonal antibody against the cytokine BAFF/BLyS (belimumab) has been  approved for the treatment of serologically active SLE. A number of other  biologics against other cytokines are in the clinical development phase and  appear to be promising for further improvement of the current therapeutic  possibilities in SLE. This article addresses the current aspects of immune  interventions with biologics for SLE and the specific challenges of this disease.

SP  - 9
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can involve any  organ system, exhibiting great diversity in presentation. Cardiac tamponade as  the initial presentation of childhood onset SLE (cSLE) is rare. We report the  case of a 10 year old Afro-Caribbean female who presented with complaints of  chest pain, shortness of breath and fever over 4 days. Clinical examination  strongly suggested cardiac tamponade which was confirmed by investigations and  treated with pericardiocentesis. After a thorough investigation, the underlying  diagnosis of SLE was confirmed using the Systemic Lupus International  Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria and high dose corticosteroid therapy  initiated. A review of recent studies shows that common initial presentations of  cSLE include constitutional symptoms, renal disease, musculoskeletal and  cutaneous involvement. In presenting this case and reviewing the literature we  emphasize the importance of cSLE as a differential diagnosis when presented with  pericarditis in the presence or absence of cardiac tamponade. In these patients  early diagnosis and treatment is desired and in this regard we also discuss the  sensitivity of the SLICC criteria in cSLE.

T1  - Value and goals of treat-to-target in systemic lupus erythematosus: knowledge and 
SP  - 507-15
AB  - Treat-to-target is a therapeutic strategy aimed at improving disease outcome  through the achievement of shared treatment goals, which has dramatically  ameliorated the prognosis of widespread disorders, such as hypertension or  diabetes. Conversely, efforts to delineate treat-to-target in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) have failed in pinpointing common goals and treatment  strategies, probably because of disease heterogeneity and lack of measurable  biomarkers predicting disease course and ensuring a safe treatment tapering  during quiescence. Given the detrimental effects of persistent disease activity  and protracted corticosteroid therapy on patients' outcome in lupus, disease  remission should be pursued whenever possible. Fortunately, clinical remission is  currently realistic for a greater number of patients than it was in the past, yet  tight monitoring is required in order for patients to benefit from disease- and  corticosteroid-free intervals, while minimizing the risk of disease flares. In  everyday practice, patients should be brought to the lowest level of disease  activity ensuring a significant benefit over a persistently active disease, being  either clinical remission or low disease activity.

SP  - 1440-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is complex and  variability in practices exists. Guidelines have been developed to help improve  the management of SLE patients, but there has been no formal evaluation of these  guidelines. This study aims to compare the scope, quality, and consistency of  clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of  patients with SLE. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched up to April 2014.  The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument and  textual synthesis was used to appraise and compare recommendations. RESULTS: Nine  clinical practice guidelines and 5 consensus statements were identified, which  covered 7 topics: diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, neuropsychiatric SLE, lupus  nephritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and other manifestations of lupus. The  methodological quality of the guidelines was variable, with the overall mean  AGREE II scores ranging from 31% to 75%, out of a maximum 100%. Scores were  consistently low for applicability, with only 1 guideline scoring above 50%.  There was substantial variability in the treatments recommended for class II and  V lupus nephritis, the recommended duration of maintenance therapy for class  III/IV lupus nephritis (from 1 to 4 years), and timing of ophthalmologic  examination for patients taking corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: Published guidelines  on SLE cover a complex area of clinical care, but the methodological quality,  scope, and recommendations varied substantially. Collaborative and  multidisciplinary efforts to develop comprehensive, high-quality evidence-based  guidelines are needed to promote best treatment and health outcomes for patients  with SLE.

T1  - Ovarian function and reproductive outcomes of female patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 196-210
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune systemic disease that  mainly affects women of reproductive age. Emerging data from recent molecular  studies show us that estrogen hormone plays a central role in the development of  this disease. By acting via its cognate receptors ERalpha and ERbeta expressed on immune  cells, estrogen can modulate immune function in both the innate and adaptive  immune responses. Interestingly, estrogen may also evoke autoimmune responses  after binding to B lymphocytes leading to the generation of high-affinity  autoantibodies and proinflammatory cytokines (so-called estrogen-induced  autoimmunity). Unfortunately, reproductive function of young female patients with  this disease is commonly compromised by different pathophysiologic processes.  First, ovarian reserve is diminished even in the presence of mild disease  suggesting a direct impact of the disease itself on ovarian function possibly due  to ovarian involvement in the form of autoimmune oophoritis. Second, SLE patients  with severe manifestations of the disease are treated with alkylating  chemotherapy agent cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide and other drugs of  alkylating category have the highest gonadotoxicity. Therefore, SLE patients  exposed to cyclophosphamide have a much higher risk of developing infertility and  premature ovarian failure than do the counterparts who are treated with other  less toxic treatments. Third, the functions of the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian  axis are perturbed by chronic inflammatory state. And finally adverse pregnancy  outcomes are more commonly observed in SLE patients such as fetal loss, preterm  birth, intrauterine fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia-eclampsia, and fetal  congenital heart block. We aimed in this review article to provide the readers an  update on how estrogen hormone closely interacts with and induces lupus-prone  changes in the immune system. We also discuss ovarian function and other  reproductive outcomes in SLE patients and the current strategies to preserve  their fertility in the light of the most recent evidence-based findings of the  clinical trials and molecular studies.

T1  - Multibacillary leprosy mimicking systemic lupus erythematosus: case report and 
SP  - 1095-102
AB  - Leprosy is an infectious chronic disease with a wide range of clinical and  serological manifestations. We report a case of a woman presenting with a malar  rash, painless oral ulcers, photosensitivity, arthritis, positive antinuclear  antibodies test and leuko-lymphopenia. Our case illustrates an unusual  presentation of leprosy initially diagnosed as systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). After the confirmation of multibacillary leprosy and multidrug therapy  recommended by the World Health Organization, a good clinical response was  observed. Recognition of rheumatic manifestations in leprosy is important as they  may be confused with SLE. A literature review is presented to encourage  clinicians to consider leprosy as a differential diagnosis. Specifically in  patients with unusual rheumatic manifestations and persistent skin lesions, and  when neurological symptoms are present. Leprosy has not been eradicated, so  misdiagnosis can be frequent. It is necessary to increase medical practitioner  awareness in order start proper treatment.

AB  - Lupus nephritis represents the most common visceral organ manifestation of  systemic lupus erythematosus and has a major impact on lupus related morbidity  and quality of life. Histologically, renal lupus involvement exhibits a broad  range of patterns, which cause diverse clinical manifestations, ranging from mild  asymptomatic urinary test abnormalities to severe nephrotic syndrome or rapidly  progressive renal failure. Therapeutic options have considerably improved over  the last decades, but despite intensive research efforts continue to be based on  relatively unspecific immunosuppression. Given their considerable side effects,  immunosuppressive treatments must be well tailored to the severity of lupus  nephritis. For such a rational treatment planning, the exact histological  diagnosis based on kidney biopsy plays a central role. This review article  summarizes the basis of pathogenesis, histological manifestations, clinical  pictures, diagnosis and treatment approaches of lupus nephritis.

SP  - 516-520
AB  - Chylous polyserositis and autoimmune myelofibrosis occurring concomitantly inn a  case of SLE are a rare phenomenon. We here report a case of a 38-year-old woman  who was admitted with a history of cough and shortness of breath for 1(1/2) months  along with fever and abdominal distension for 1 month. She also had arthralgias,  weight loss and pancytopenia. She was diagnosed as a case of SLE with Chylous  polyserositis and autoimmune myelofibrosis. She was started on steroids and  immunosuppressive therapy, to which she responded. To summarize, this is the  first case report where chylous polyserositis and pancytopenia due to autoimmune  myelofibrosis occurred which was responsive to steroids and immunosuppressive  therapy.

T1  - Tolerogenic dendritic cells: role and therapeutic implications in systemic lupus 
SP  - 250-9
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen presenting cells that activate T cells and  determine the outcome of immune response. In addition to their important function  in defense against pathogens, DCs are increasingly recognized as playing a  crucial role in the regulation of immune tolerance. Plasticity of DCs with  different maturity status and functions enable them to be exploited as potential  cell-based therapy to restore immune tolerance in autoimmune diseases. Various ex  vivo methods have been developed to generate stable tolerogenic DCs that are able  to induce and maintain regulatory T cell homeostasis. The beneficial effect of  tolerogenic DCs have been studied in murine autoimmune models with promising  results. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic multi-systemic  autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibody production and deposition of  immune complexes in organs. There are evidences that dysregulated DCs play a  pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of lupus disease. Peripheral  blood monocytes in SLE patients were found to have active phenotype with  accelerated differentiation into DCs efficient in antigen presentation.  Plasmacytoid DCs in SLE patients produce high levels of interferon-alpha, the  signature cytokine of this disease, that cause a positive feedback loop in the  amplification of activation of innate and adaptive immunity. Furthermore,  manipulation of DCs via toll-like receptor knockout in a murine lupus model leads  to alteration in disease severity and survival. Thus, tolerogenic DCs may appear  as a potential cell-based therapeutic option in SLE.

T1  - Mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 164-71
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells are a rare subset of stem cells residing in the bone  marrow where they closely interact with hematopoietic stem cells and support  their growth and differentiation. They can suppress proliferation or functions of  many immune cells such as T cells, B cells, natural killer cells and dendritic  cells. Recently, a substantial progress has been made in the field of mesenchymal  stem cell transplantation. Experimental and clinical data suggest that this  therapy has been a promising strategy for severe and refractory systemic lupus  erythematosus.

T1  - Relevance of lymphocyte subsets to B cell-targeted therapy in systemic lupus 
SP  - 208-18
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease with  heterogeneous clinical manifestations, and pathologically characterized by  activation of autoreactive T cells and overproduction of autoantibodies by B  cells. Although corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are widely used for the  treatment, safer and more effective therapies are needed. B cells play a pivotal  role in the pathogenesis of SLE not only by producing pathogenic autoantibodies  but also by modulating immune responses via production of cytokines and  chemokines. The potential efficacy of B-cell depletion therapy has been reported  in SLE. Treatment with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, results in  reconstitution of B cells in the periphery, thereby inhibiting T cell activation  and differentiation, which in turn leads to long-term remission of SLE. However,  we have reported SLE recurrence driven by B cell- or T cell-memory activation  after long-term remission, demonstrating pathological heterogeneity in SLE.  Ideally, differential targeting therapies should be considered according to  relevant lymphocyte subsets. Therefore, evaluation of peripheral blood lymphocyte  subsets could be valuable for predicting the response to B cell-targeted therapy.  A better understanding of B cell pathology should contribute to the development  of novel specific therapies for SLE.

T1  - State of the art: Reproduction and pregnancy in rheumatic diseases.
SP  - 376-86
AB  - Throughout the last decade, increasing awareness has been raised on issues  related to reproduction in rheumatic diseases including basic research to clarify  the important role of estrogens in the etiology and pathophysiology of  immune/inflammatory diseases. Sub- or infertility is a heterogeneous condition  that can be related to immunological mechanisms, to pregnancy loss, to disease  burden, to therapy, and to choices in regard to family size. Progress in  reproductive medicine has made it possible for more patients with rheumatic  disease to have children. Active disease in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  affects their children's birth weight and may have long-term effects on their  future health status. Pregnancy complications as preeclampsia and intrauterine  growth restriction are still increased in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), however, biomarkers can  monitor adverse events, and several new therapies may improve outcomes.  Pregnancies in women with APS remain a challenge, and better therapies for the  obstetric APS are needed. New prospective studies indicate improved outcomes for  pregnancies in women with rare diseases like systemic sclerosis and vasculitis.  TNF inhibitors hold promise for maintaining remission in rheumatological patients  and may be continued at least in the first half of pregnancy. Pre-conceptional  counseling and interdisciplinary management of pregnancies are essential for  ensuring optimal pregnancy outcomes.

SP  - 57-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis  (LETM), a rare but disabling condition defined as a lesion of the spinal cord  that extends over four or more vertebrae on MRI, in association with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We present a rare case of LETM involving the  cervical and thoracic spinal cord in a patient with SLE and review the existing  literature on the association of lupus-associated myelitis. RESULTS: LETM is  included within the diagnostic criteria for Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), but is  also known to be associated with a wide range of auto-immune diseases. Only 37  cases of LETM in patients with SLE have been previously described. We performed  an updated review on epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis,  management, and prognosis of LETM in the setting of SLE. CONCLUSION: Due to the  generally poor prognosis of LETM in SLE patients, prompt diagnosis and treatment  is of critical importance for a positive clinical outcome. We provide a  comprehensive perspective of past and current literature in order to aid  diagnosis and management of this rare phenomenon.

T1  - Antiphospholipid syndrome: 30 years and our contribution.
SP  - 233-41
AB  - In 1983, Graham Hughes first described the concept of antiphospholipid syndrome  (APS). In 1984, we described the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system  which directly detected circulating aCL in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) who revealed biological false positive serological test for  syphilis. In 1990, three groups, including our group, independently reported the  necessity of a cofactor for the binding of autoimmune anticardiolipin antibodies  (aCL) to the solid phase phospholipids. beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) was identified  as this cofactor. In 1994,the epitope for aCL was shown to develop when beta2GPI is  adsorbed on polyoxygenated polystyrene plates. In 2000, we described  antiprothrombin antibodies bind to prothrombin exposed to immobilized  phosphatidylserine and established a phosphatidylserine dependent monoclonal  antiprothrombin antibody. In 2004, a novel role of nicked beta2GPI was identified in  the negative feedback pathway of extrinsic fibrinolysis. Nicked beta2GPI was found  to bind angiostatin 4.5 and to attenuate its antiangiogenic property. In 2004, we  demonstrated that the p38 MAPK pathway mediates induction of the TF gene in  stimulated with human monoclonal anti- beta2GPI antibodies. Very recently, beta2GPI was  identified as a complement regulator. The cross-link between complement  activation and prothrombotic status in patients with APS has been drawn much  attention. Genetic factors are hypothesized to play a role in the susceptibility  to APS based on several family studies in patients with antiphospholipid  antibodies (aPL) and/or clinical manifestations of APS. The genetics of beta2GPI has  been extensively studied. 247 Val/Leu polymorphism can affect the conformational  change of beta2-GPI and the exposure of the epitopes for aCL. We found that 247 Val  was correlated with anti-beta2-GPI production in patients with primary APS, and 247  Val may be important for beta2-GPI antigenicity. STAT4 SNP in Japanese patients with  SLE and/or APS. T allele frequencies in SLE and APS were significantly elevated  compared with that in healthy controls. When analyzed only in primary APS  patients, T allele frequency was further higher. BANK1, BLK and SNP in 1q25.1  region were associated with not only SLE but also APS in Japanese population.  These results suggest that APS and SLE, in part, share a common genetic  background.

T1  - Current role of rituximab in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 154-63
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized  by periods of flares and remission, resulting in organ damage over time caused by  persistent disease activity and treatment-related complications. Conventional  therapies are not ideal in terms of efficacy and safety. Novel biological  therapies are being developed to enhance therapeutic efficacy, minimize disease  exacerbation and reduce toxicities. As dysregulation of B cells is the hallmark  of SLE, B-cell targeted therapies are the focus of recent clinical research.  Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has been used with success  in recalcitrant lupus manifestations. However, randomized controlled trials have  failed to reveal its benefit in renal and non-renal SLE when combined with  conventional immunosuppressive protocols. Although heterogeneity of SLE  manifestations, pitfalls in study design and the limitations of the assessment  tools for various clinical end points may have contributed to the discouraging  results, rituximab remains an option in patients who are refractory or intolerant  to conventional therapies. Recently, a regimen consisting of rituximab and  mycophenolate mofetil without oral corticosteroids was reported to be effective  in lupus nephritis. While the efficacy of this regimen has to be confirmed,  future controlled trials should focus on the efficacy of rituximab in refractory  lupus manifestations and its synergistic effect with other immunosuppressive  agents such as cyclophosphamide. In short-term randomized controlled trials, a  non-significant increase in serious adverse events was observed in SLE patients  treated with rituximab. Long-term safety data of rituximab in SLE, in particular  the incidence of hypogammaglobulinemia and serious/opportunistic infections, have  to be continuously surveyed.

SP  - 270-6
AB  - In the present study, we performed a retrospective study on the indication,  efficacy and causes of withdrawal of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Moreover, a review of the literature  concerning the use of MMF in the real life was performed. We recorded data about  indications, mean dosage, duration of treatment and reasons for drug withdrawal.  The efficacy was evaluated according to changes in SLE Disease Activity Index  2000 (SLEDAI-2K), renal SLEDAI-2K and daily proteinuria, after 4 and 12 months of  treatment. Six hundred and nine SLE patients were evaluated; among them, 109  patients (17.9 %) were treated with MMF (mean treatment duration 33.9 +/- 31.2  months, mean dosage 28.1 +/- 10.6 mg/kg). The most frequent indications for using  MMF were lupus nephritis (55.9 %) and musculoskeletal manifestations (33.0 %).  After 4 and 12 months, a significant reduction of mean SLEDAI-2K, renal SLEDAI  and daily proteinuria, compared with baseline, was demonstrated. Thirty-one  patients (28.4 %) discontinued MMF therapy (mean treatment duration at the time  of discontinuation 17.5 +/- 21.2 months). The incidence risks of MMF  discontinuation due to inefficacy and side effects were 0.09 and 0.1,  respectively. Patients with disease duration longer than 36 months (70.6 %) had a  significant increased risk of MMF withdrawal (RR 0.4, P = 0.03). The results of  the present study demonstrated that MMF should be considered a treatment option  for SLE manifestation other than renal involvement in daily clinical practice.

SP  - 375-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) is a rare but potentially fatal complication that occurs most  frequently in the context of active lupus with involvement of other organs. The  objective of this study is to report the clinical features and prognosis of  patients with SLE who had PH. METHODS: Patients with SLE (1982 American College  of Rheumatology criteria) and PH under monitoring between June 1999 and November  2011 were studied. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and prognosis  data related to PH were analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven patients with SLE developed 14  episodes of PH. PH was the first manifestation of SLE in 2 patients. The most  frequent symptoms and clinical signs were dyspnea, fever and cough, which  occurred in 12 (85%), 11 (77%) and 7 (50%) patients, respectively. Hemoptysis was  also observed in 5 (35%) episodes, tachycardia in 2 (14%), pallor in one (7%) and  chest pain in one (7%). All patients had other concomitant organ involvement, and  were treated with glucocorticoids. In addition, intravenous cyclophosphamide was  indicated in 12 episodes and plasma exchange in 4. Overall mortality was 64%.  Factors associated with mortality were infection, mechanical ventilation and  dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: PH continues to be a rare and severe complication of SLE.  Its suspected presence forces us to quickly study these patients, since early  diagnosis and aggressive treatment have been shown to improve survival in them.

T1  - Nasal septal ulceration.
SP  - 817-26
AB  - Nasal septal ulceration can have multiple etiologies. Determining the exact cause  depends on who the consulting specialist is, who could either be the ENT surgeon  or the dermatologist. The common causes are infections (tuberculosis, leprosy,  leishmaniasis), vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome),  and lupus erythematosus. Traumatic causes and malignancy can also be seen in  tertiary referral centers. The diagnosis often requires thorough investigations  and multiple tissue specimens from various sites, and in chronic cases, a  suspicion of lymphoma should be considered. Apart from disease-specific therapy,  a multidisciplinary approach is required in most cases to tackle the cosmetic  disfigurement.

SP  - 522-7
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes many  psychological repercussions that have been studied through qualitative research.  These are considered relevant, since they reveal the amplitude experienced by  patients. Given this importance, this study aims to map the qualitative  production in this theme, derived from studies of experiences of adult patients  of both genders and that had used as a tool a semi-structured interview and/or  field observations, and had made use of a sampling by a saturation criterion to  determine the number of participants in each study. The survey was conducted in  Pubmed, Lilacs, Psycinfo e Cochrane databases, searching productions in English  and Portuguese idioms published between January 2005 and June 2012. The 19  revised papers that have dealt with patients in the acute phase of the disease  showed themes that were categorized into eight topics that contemplated the  experienced process at various stages, from the onset of the disease, extending  through the knowledge of the diagnosis and the understanding of the  manifestations of the disease, drug treatment and general care, evolution and  prognosis. The collected papers also point to the difficulty of understanding, of  the patients, on what consists the remission phase, revealing also that this is a  clinical stage underexplored by psychological studies.

T1  - Indices to assess patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in clinical trials, 
SP  - S-85-95
AB  - This review summarises most currently used indices to assess and monitor patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in clinical trials, long-term  observational studies, and clinical care. Six SLE disease activity indices  include the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Index (BILAG), European  Consensus Lupus Activity Measurement (ECLAM), Systemic Lupus Activity Measure  (SLAM), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), Lupus  Activity Index (LAI), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Activity Questionnaire  (SLAQ). Three SLE responder indices include Responder Index for Lupus  Erythematosus (RIFLE), SLE Responder Index (SRI), and BILAG Based Combined Lupus  Assessment (BICLA). Three SLE damage indices include the Systemic Lupus  International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology-Damage Index  (SLICC/ACE-DI), Lupus Damage Index Questionnaire (LDIQ), and Brief Index of Lupus  Damage (BILD). The SLAQ, LDIQ and the BILD are patient self-report  questionnaires, which appear to give similar information to physician-completed  indices, but are pragmatically more easily completed as patients do almost all  the work. Additional self-report indices which have been used to assess and  monitor patients with in SLE include a generic general health short form 36  (SF36), a SLE-specific Lupus Patient Reported Outcome (LupusPRO), and a generic  rheumatology index, Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3). These  activity, response, damage and patient self-report indices have been validated at  different levels with no consensus about what it is the most appropriate for  every setting. Sensitive and feasible assessment of SLE in clinical trials,  observational studies, and busy clinical settings remains a challenge to the  rheumatology community.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric questionnaires in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - S-59-64
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be affected by a multitude  of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms with a wide range of prevalence and  severity. Irrespectively from attribution to SLE or other causes,  neuropsychiatric (NP) symptoms strongly impact short-term and long-term outcomes,  thus NP evaluation during routine clinical practice in SLE should be undertaken  regularly. The assessment of NP involvement in SLE patients is challenging and  the available diagnostic tools fail to guarantee optimal diagnostic accuracy,  sensitivity to changes as well as feasibility in routine clinical care.  Standardised questionnaires (both physician-administered and self-reported) can  offer valuable help to the treating physician to capture all possible NP  syndromes; few SLE-specific NP questionnaire have been developed but validation  in large cohort or cross-cultural adaptations are still pending. On the other  hand, general instruments have been largely applied to SLE patients. Both kinds  of questionnaires can address all possible NP manifestations either globally or,  more frequently, focus on specific NP symptoms. These latter have been mainly  used in SLE to detect and classify mild and subtle symptoms, more likely to be  overlooked during routine clinical assessment such as headache, cognitive  impairment and psychiatric manifestations. In conclusion, this literature review  highlights a clear case for validation studies in this area and the wider  implementation of questionnaires to assess NP involvement is still warranted. The  broader use of such instruments could have important consequences; first of all,  by standardising symptom assessment, a better definition of the prevalence of NP  manifestation across different centres could be achieved. Secondly, prospective  studies could allow for the evaluation of clinical significance of mild symptoms  and their impact on the patient's function and quality of life.

T1  - Aplastic anemia as a feature of systemic lupus erythematosus: a case report and 
SP  - 1073-82
AB  - Peripheral cytopenias are common in systemic lupus erythematosus, but bone marrow  involvement is rarely reported. Aplastic anemia is the result of immune-mediated  destruction of hematopoietic stem cells causing pancytopenia and characterized by  an empty bone marrow. This rare but serious disease has been described as an  unusual manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. We reviewed the 25 cases  published in the English language literature and discuss the clinical  presentation, outcome, treatment, and pathophysiology of aplastic anemia as a  complication of systemic lupus erythematosus. We report here the first case of  aplastic anemia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with an  allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Over one half of patients received  concomitantly the diagnoses of systemic lupus erythematosus and aplastic anemia.  No clinical or histological features can distinguish primary aplastic anemia from  aplastic anemia occurring in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. The overall  mortality is about 15% and corticosteroid-based therapy alone or in combination  with other immunomodulatory drugs can restore bone marrow function. Systemic  lupus erythematosus may be complicated by bone marrow involvement. The diagnosis  of peripheral cytopenias should be confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. All these  patients should receive cortisone as a first treatment. Plasma exchanges seem to  have some efficacy. Other different immunomodulatory therapies were used with  variable results.

T1  - Intravenous immunoglobulin in the therapeutic armamentarium of systemic lupus 
SP  - e86
AB  - Prepared from the plasma of thousands of blood donors, therapeutic intravenous  immunoglobulin (IVIg) mostly consists of human polyspecific immunoglobulin G  (IgG). The use of IVIg in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is still considered  experimental without any clear indications. The purpose of this systematic review  is, therefore, to evaluate the available evidence to determine the therapeutic  role of IVIg in SLE. A comprehensive, computerised search was performed in the  MEDLINE (Pubmed), Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane controlled trials. The study  eligibility criteria were randomized controlled trials, and prospective and  retrospective observational studies that examined the efficacy of IVIg in adult  patients with SLE who were considered the participants.IVIg therapy was the mode  of intervention in these patients. Data abstracted included the study design,  study population, changes in the disease activity scores (Systemic Lupus  Erythematosus Disease Activity Index, Systemic Lupus Activity Measure, and Lupus  Activity Index-Pregnancy), steroid dose, complement levels, autoantibodies, and  renal function. Thereafter, data analysis established statistical procedures for  meta-analysis. Thirteen studies (including 3 controlled and 10 observational)  were eligible for inclusion. There was significant reduction in the SLE disease  activity scores with IVIg therapy with a standard mean difference of 0.584 (P =  0.002, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.221-0.947). In terms of rise in complement  levels, the response rate was 30.9% (P = 0.001, 95 CI 22.1-41.3). The effects of  IVIg on other clinical outcome measures including anti-double-stranded DNA,  antinuclear antibody, average steroid dose, and renal function could not be  determined because of the limited numbers of trials. The limitations of this  review were lack of well-designed controlled trials with adequate sample size on  the use of IVIg in SLE. In conclusion, the use of IVIg is associated with  significant reduction in SLE disease activity and improvement in complement  levels.

T1  - Association of autoimmune hepatitis and systemic lupus erythematodes: a case 
SP  - 12662-7
AB  - Liver test abnormalities have been described in up to 60% of patients with  systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE) at some point during the course of their  disease. Prior treatment with potentially hepatotoxic drugs or viral hepatitis is  commonly considered to be the main cause of liver disease in SLE patients.  However, in rare cases elevated liver enzymes may be due to concurrent autoimmune  hepatitis (AIH). To distinguish whether the patient has primary liver disease  with associated autoimmune clinical and laboratory features resembling SLE - such  as AIH - or the elevation of liver enzymes is a manifestation of SLE remains a  difficult challenge for the treating physician. Here, we present six female  patients with complex autoimmune disorders and hepatitis. Patient charts were  reviewed in order to investigate the complex relationship between SLE and AIH.  All patients had coexisting autoimmune disease in their medical history. At the  time of diagnosis of AIH, patients presented with arthralgia, abdominal  complaints, cutaneous involvement and fatigue as common symptoms. All patients  fulfilled the current diagnostic criteria of both, AIH and SLE. Remission of  acute hepatitis was achieved in all cases after the initiation of  immunosuppressive therapy. In addition to this case study a literature review was  conducted.

T1  - Immunosuppressive therapies for the induction treatment of proliferative lupus 
SP  - 1998-2007
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and determine the most effective immunosuppressive therapy  for the induction treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis (PLN) based on renal  remission. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was  conducted. The outcomes were renal remission at 6 months: (1) normalization of  serum creatinine [(sCr), or within 15% of the normal range, i.e., sCr < 132  micromol/l - creatinine remission]; and (2) proteinuric remission (prU < 0.5  g/day/1.73m(2)). A Bayesian network metaanalysis was used. RESULTS: The OR (95%  credible interval) of inducing an sCr remission at 6 months was 1.70 (0.51, 6.87)  for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) versus cyclophosphamide (CYC); 2.16 (0.38, 13.36)  for tacrolimus (Tac) versus CYC; and 1.25 (0.13, 10.51) for Tac versus MMF. For  proteinuric remission the OR was 1.46 (0.81, 3.04) for MMF versus CYC; 1.96  (0.80, 5.11) for Tac versus CYC; and 1.34 (0.43, 3.90) for Tac versus MMF. The  probability (95% credible interval) of inducing a creatinine remission at 6  months was Tac 56% (19%, 88%); MMF 51% (23%, 79%); and CYC 37% (28%, 47%). The  probability of inducing a proteinuric remission was Tac 41% (23%, 63%); MMF 34%  (23%, 50%); CYC 26% (20%, 32%); azathioprine 10% (1%, 55%); prednisone 11% (2%,  38%). None of the results were conclusive when examined in a sensitivity  analysis. CONCLUSION: There is currently insufficient evidence to determine which  of these immunosuppressive agents is superior. The probability of renal remission  is 50% or lower at 6 months.

T1  - Good prognosis for hospitalized SLE patients with non-related disease.
SP  - 1090-3
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by  widespread organ involvement. Given the scope of modern treatment, there has been  a rise in life expectancy and quality with a mean estimated 5-year survival of  82%-90%. Hence, hospitalizations of SLE patients for non-SLE related causes have  not been investigated. Our aim was to characterize the SLE patients admitted to  the internal medicine wards, the main diagnosis at admission, and the course of  hospitalization and to compare the outcome with the general population. We  expected to find a significant difference between the SLE population and the  general population regarding hospitalization parameters. However we found a good  prognosis for hospitalized SLE patients with non-related disease compared to the  non-SLE group. SLE was not a significant prognostic factor for outcome in  patients hospitalized in the internal medicine ward for non-related causes. Men  with SLE had a worse prognosis during hospitalization when compared to females.  The SLEDAI score was not an appropriate prognostic method for the outcome of  hospitalization.

T1  - Predictors of cardiovascular events in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 1435-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease represents an important cause of morbidity and  mortality in patients with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), due  to a complex interplay between traditional risk factors and disregulation of  autoimmunity but uncertainty is still present about the most important predictors  of cardiovascular events. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our work was to perform a  collaborative systematic review on the main predictors of cardiovascular events  in SLE patients. METHODS: PubMed and Cochrane were systematically searched for  eligible studies on SLE and cardiovascular events between January 2008 and  December 2012. Study features, patient characteristics and incidence of stent  thrombosis were abstracted and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect  methods (point estimate - 95% confidence intervals) and consistency of predictors  was formally appraised. RESULTS: A total of 17,187 patients was included; of  those, 93.1% were female and the median age was 39 years. After a median  follow-up period of 8 years, cardiovascular events presented in 25.4%, including  acute myocardial infarction (4.1%) and stroke (7.3%). The most important  predictors may be divided into traditional risk factors, such as male gender (OR  6.2, CI 95% 1.49-25), hyperlipidaemia (OR 3.9, CI 95% 1.57-9.71), familiar  history of cardiac disease (OR 3.6, CI 95% 1.15-11.32) and hypertension (OR 3.5,  CI 95% 1.65-7.54), and SLE-related features, such as the presence of  auto-antibodies (OR 5.8 and 5.0, CI 95% 3.28-7.78) and neurological disorders (OR  5.2, CI 95% 2.0-13.9). A low correlation was shown for the importance of organ  damage and SLE activity (respectively OR 1.4, CI 95% 1.09-4.44 and OR 1.2, CI 95%  1.2-1.2), as well as for age at diagnosis (OR 1.1, CI 95% 1.07-1.17).  CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular events in SLE patients are caused by a multifactorial  mechanism, including both traditional and disease-specific risk factors. A global  valuation with an individual risk stratification based on both these features is  important to correctly manage these patients in order to reduce negative  outcomes.

T1  - Invasive fungal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review of 
SP  - 325-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a life-threatening complication of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or its treatment. We conducted a  systematic review to characterize IFD in SLE and identify risk factors and  outcomes. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched up to June  2013 using MeSH terms and keywords pertaining to SLE and IFD. Two independent  reviewers selected adult cohort studies and case series/reports on IFD in SLE  based on the established classification criteria for both diseases. RESULTS: In  total, 393 cases from 182 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Cryptococcus  spp., Aspergillus spp., and Candida spp. were the most common fungal pathogens.  Cohorts described IFD in 0.6-3.2% of SLE inpatients and 0.28% of SLE outpatients.  IFD occurred at a median of 2 years of disease duration (IQR: 0.5-7.1), and 39%  of cases occurred within the first year of SLE. Disease activity and  corticosteroid dose >60mg/day emerged as risk factors for IFD. IFD was associated  with a mortality rate of 53% (161/316 cases), and worse in the absence of  antifungal therapy (n = 43). Overall, 44 cases of IFD were only diagnosed on  autopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review confirms the severe sequelae of IFD  in SLE. Cases occurred in patients with active SLE, who were on high daily  corticosteroids doses and at early stages of disease. This highlights the role of  poor disease control and a high "net state of immunosuppression" in risk. IFD in  SLE should be prospectively examined in the modern era.

T1  - The dialysis scenario in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1507-13
AB  - Although prognosis of lupus nephritis has improved over time, a substantial  amount of lupus patients still reach end-stage renal disease and require  dialysis. Treatment of these patients can be challenging, since the disease poses  a number of problems that can portend a poor prognosis, such as infections, lupus  reactivations, vascular access thrombosis and cardiovascular complications.  Consensus is lacking among investigators about the real incidence of these  complications and related diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, the choice of the  type of dialysis treatment and the overall prognosis are still a matter of  debate. In this paper, we have reviewed the currently available literature in an  attempt to answer the most controversial issues about the topic.

T1  - The need to define treatment goals for systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 567-71
AB  - In the current therapeutic climate, mortality rates from systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) remain unacceptably high. Although new therapies are on the  horizon, pending their emergence and availability, optimization of the currently  available therapies is potentially achievable. A 'treat-to-target' approach is  now considered routine for many diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, for  which it has substantially improved patient outcomes. The heterogeneity of SLE,  as well as lack of universal agreement over methods to measure disease activity  and treatment responses, has impeded the development of such an approach for this  disease. In this article, the potential benefits of a treatment-target definition  are explored, obstacles to the development of a treatment target in SLE are  identified, and possible strategies to achieve this goal are discussed.

T1  - Immune complex-mediated autoimmunity in a patient With Smith-Magenis syndrome 
SP  - 291-3
AB  - Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) is a sporadic congenital disorder involving multiple  organ systems caused by chromosome 17p11.2 deletions. Smith-Magenis syndrome  features craniofacial and skeletal anomalies, cognitive impairment, and  neurobehavioral abnormalities. In addition, some SMS patients may exhibit  hypogammaglobulinemia. We report the first case of SMS-associated autoimmunity in  a woman who presented with adult onset of multiple autoimmune disorders,  including systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and  autoimmune hepatitis. Molecular analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphism  array confirmed a de novo 3.8-Mb deletion (breakpoints, chr17:  16,660,721-20,417,975), resulting in haploinsufficiency for TACI (transmembrane  activator and CAML interactor). Our data are consistent with potential loss of  function for the BAFF (B cell-activating factor) receptor TACI as a contributing  factor to human autoimmune phenomena.

T1  - Recent clinical trials in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 519-35, ix
AB  - Recent clinical trials have provided evidence for the efficacy of low-dose  intravenous cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil as induction treatment for  patients with proliferative lupus nephritis in comparative trials with  standard-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. Trials of maintenance treatments have  had more variable results, but suggest that the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil  may be similar to that of quarterly standard-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide  and somewhat more efficacious than azathioprine. Differential responses to  mycophenolate mofetil based on ethnicity suggest that it may be more effective in  black and Hispanic patients. Rituximab was not efficacious as an adjunct to  induction treatment with mycophenolate mofetil.

T1  - Post-marketing experiences with belimumab in the treatment of SLE patients.
SP  - 507-17, viii
AB  - Belimumab (Benlysta) is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets and  inhibits soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator, also known as B-cell activating factor,  a proliferation and survival factor for B cells. The published clinical trials  data showed that in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  belimumab effectively reduced peripheral B-cell levels and improved disease  activity. This article reviews the belimumab clinical trials and the  post-marketing experience with belimumab in the treatment of those lupus patients  with persistent active disease despite current standard of care (SOC) therapy.

SP  - 433-54, vii-viii
AB  - Genetic factors seem to play a more important role early in the course of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), whereas nongenetic factors seem to play a  more important role over the course of the disease. SLE is more frequent with  less favorable outcomes in nonwhite populations. To overcome these differences  and reduce the immediate-term, mediate-term, and long-term impact of SLE among  disadvantaged populations, it is essential to increase disease awareness, to  improve access to health care and to provide care to these patients in a  consistent manner regardless of the severity of their disease.

T1  - Advances in the assessment of lupus disease activity and damage.
SP  - 510-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To provide an update on the advances in the assessment of  disease activity and damage in systemic lupus erythematosus. RECENT FINDINGS:  Over the last couple of years, the development of composite responder indices has  led to better description of the changes in disease activity, especially for  clinical trials. It has been recognized that newer composite responder indices  such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI) and BILAG-based  Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) capture more comprehensive clinical response as  they integrate global lupus assessment, system-based assessment, physician's  global assessment and treatment failure defined as an increase in the dose of  steroid and/or immunosuppressant. The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease  Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) Responder Index 50 (SRI-50) may be more practical  for capturing response in clinical practice. British Isles Lupus Assessment Group  2004 (BILAG 2004) Index may capture flare slightly better than the other  available flare indices whilst also capturing response. SUMMARY: This review will  provide an insight into the various tools available to assess disease activity  and damage in lupus, with a particular focus on the new responder indices  currently in use.

T1  - Is there still a role for abatacept in the treatment of lupus?
SP  - 1345-50
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The quest for safer and more effective treatments for systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) has led to the development of many new biologic  therapies. Abatacept is the first drug targeting co-stimulation between T cells  and antigen presenting cells, with abundant pre-clinical evidence to support its  use in SLE. AREAS COVERED: This review will present the relevant aspects of lupus  pathophysiology pertaining to the mechanism of action of abatacept, a summary of  murine studies and the latest human clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: Abatacept  has demonstrated efficacy in both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis,  and earlier studies have suggested tantalising evidence of efficacy in SLE.  However, the latest randomised double-blinded study showed disappointingly  negative results, much like the case of rituximab in SLE. Currently, abatacept  remains a possible therapeutic option as an off-label therapy, and it is a part  of our therapeutic armamentarium in difficult cases. The need to find appropriate  definitions of response and optimal study design continues to be paramount in the  field of lupus therapies.

T1  - Use of belimumab throughout pregnancy to treat active systemic lupus 
SP  - 195-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy can lead to flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  and the presence of SLE in pregnancy could lead to a poor outcome for the mother  and the fetus. OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient whose active SLE (including lupus  nephritis) was managed with the use of belimumab throughout pregnancy. METHODS: A  case report and review of relevant literature is presented. RESULTS: A  38-year-old Caucasian woman with SLE was seen for advice regarding planning a  pregnancy and management of her active lupus (cutaneous lupus, angioedema, lupus  nephritis, leukopenia, and anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome) that could only  be controlled by mycophenolate, a drug contraindicated in pregnancy.  Azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, rituximab, and moderate doses of prednisone  were either unable to control her disease or led to unacceptable toxicity. After  detailed discussions, she was treated with belimumab, which controlled her SLE  and allowed withdrawal of mycophenolate. Belimumab was continued throughout the  pregnancy, leading to well-controlled SLE and uneventful course, albeit with the  presence of mild Ebstein's anomaly in the baby. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge,  this is the first case report of belimumab use throughout pregnancy for  controlling active SLE. Data from the belimumab pregnancy registry would be  useful to confirm our findings and to further assess safety of this agent for use  in pregnancy.

T1  - Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody as a marker of erosive arthritis in 
SP  - 1156-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody is an established  marker in the diagnosis and prognostication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Infrequently, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients also develop a  deforming erosive arthritis, similar to that of RA. Our objective was to  determine whether anti-CCP antibody is a useful marker of erosive disease in SLE  patients presenting with arthritis. METHODS: Electronic databases EMBASE, MEDLINE  and non-indexed MEDLINE citations were searched through April 11, 2014, using the  outlined key terms. Studies meeting predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria  were reviewed. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of included  articles using previously described criteria. The DerSimonian-Laird random  effects model was used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity of  anti-CCP antibody for erosive arthritis in SLE. RESULTS: Seven articles met  inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 609 SLE patients with arthritis were  identified, 70 of whom had erosive disease. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of  anti-CCP antibody for erosive arthritis was 47.8% (95% CI, 26.2%-70.2%) and 91.8%  (95% CI, 78.4%-97.2%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that  anti-CCP antibody is a highly specific marker for erosive arthritis in SLE.  Longitudinal prospective studies are needed to determine if anti-CCP antibody can  be used as a predictor of erosive disease.

T1  - Treatment of lupus nephritis: practical issues in Asian countries.
SP  - 138-45
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and severe manifestation of systemic lupus  erythematosus in Asian patients, and is an important cause of renal failure in  Asian countries. Immunosuppressive treatments of LN have evolved over the past  few decades and resulted in improvements in patient outcomes. Treatment  guidelines have been recently published by rheumatology and nephrology  communities in the USA and Europe, but the emphasis was more on patients of  African or Hispanic descent and Caucasians. There is increasing evidence that  racial and ethnic variations are associated with differences in disease  manifestations, pharmacogenomics/kinetics, response to therapy and complications  of disease or treatment. There is substantial data confirming the efficacy of  combined corticosteroids and either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF) as initial treatments for active Class III/IV LN in Asian patients.  Azathioprine, MMF or a calcineurin inhibitor, or possibly mizoribine which  requires further investigation in non-Japanese patients, in combination with  low-dose corticosteroids, can be considered as maintenance immunosuppression to  prevent disease flares, and the optimal choice needs to take into account  tolerability and prior induction therapy. Treatment costs and accessibility to  specialist healthcare facilities, compliance which in turn is related to  socio-economic and education status, as well as regional variations in risk of  infections, including subacute infection such as tuberculosis or chronic  infections such as hepatitis B or C, are issues that are distinctly pertinent in  Asia.

T1  - Childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus: how is it different from adult SLE?
SP  - 182-91
AB  - About 20% of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) starts in childhood and children  have less gender bias in favor of females as compared to adults. Systemic  manifestations, nephritis, neuro-psychiatric disease and cytopenias are more  common in children at presentation than adults. Since most children develop lupus  in their early adolescence, dealing with the diagnosis of an unpredictable  lifelong disease during this phase of life is challenging. Physicians must  recognise specific medical and social needs of this age group, for optimal  long-term outcome. Steroids and immunosuppressive drugs are the cornerstone for  treatment in children as with adults with lupus. The outcome has improved  considerably with these drugs and 10-year survival is nearly 90%. Due to longer  life spans more damage accrues in children as compared to adults. Most of the  drugs are associated with significant toxicity and the goal of having a drug  which reduces disease activity and damage without hampering normal growth,  development and fertility is still an elusive one. The current review focuses on  clinical and immunological aspects of childhood SLE and how it differs from  adulthood SLE.

T1  - Concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus and HIV: case series and literature 
SP  - 186-94
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the course of each other and to  review the published reports on concomitant SLE and HIV infection. METHODS: We  performed a retrospective review of the records of patients with SLE and HIV seen  in the Department of Rheumatology at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital,  Durban, South Africa. We used the terms "systemic lupus erythematosus" and "HIV"  or "AIDS" to identify patients with SLE and HIV infection reported in the English  medical literature. RESULTS: We identified 13 patients with SLE and HIV  infection. All the patients were females and there were 11 African blacks and 2  Indians. SLE and HIV infection were diagnosed together in 6 patients. In this  group, there were 5 lupus flares in 4 patients, and 2 of the flares followed  highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART). Five patients developed HIV  after the diagnosis of SLE. The 3 patients in whom follow-up data was available  had inactive SLE, one of whom was on HAART. Two HIV-positive patients developed  SLE after receiving HAART for 30 and 35 mo. Seven of our patients also had  tuberculosis. Our literature search identified 58 previously reported patients  with HIV and SLE. CONCLUSION: Our case series and review of the literature show  that there is a reduction in SLE disease activity in patients with concomitant  SLE and HIV. However, when lupus flares occur in HIV-positive patients, they are  unrelated to the use of HAART.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1878-1888
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a remarkable and challenging disorder. Its  diversity of clinical features is matched by the complexity of the factors  (genetic, hormonal, and environmental) that cause it, and the array of  autoantibodies with which it is associated. In this Seminar we reflect on changes  in its classification criteria; consider aspects of its more serious clinical  expression; and provide a brief review of its aetiopathogenesis, major  complications, coping strategies, and conventional treatment. Increased  understanding of the cells and molecules involved in the development of the  diseases has encouraged the identification of new, better targeted biological  approaches to its treatment. The precise role of these newer therapies remains to  be established.

T1  - Challenges for lupus management in emerging countries.
SP  - e209-20
AB  - In emerging countries, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been associated  with several unfavorable outcomes including disease activity, damage accrual,  work disability and mortality. Poor socioeconomic status (SES) and lack of access  to healthcare, especially in medically underserved communities, may be  responsible for many of the observed disparities. Diagnostic delay of SLE or for  severe organ damages (renal involvement) have a negative impact on those adverse  outcomes in lupus patients who either belong to minority groups or live in  emerging countries. Longitudinal and observational prospective studies and  registries may help to identify the factors that influence poor SLE outcomes in  emerging countries. Infection is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in  SLE, particularly in low SES patients and tuberculosis appears to be frequent in  SLE patients living in endemic areas (mainly emerging countries). Thus,  tuberculosis screening should be systematically performed and prophylaxis  discussed for patients from these areas. SLE treatment in the developing world is  restricted by the availability and cost of some immunosuppressive drugs.  Moreover, poor adherence has been associated to bad outcomes in lupus patients  with a higher risk of flares, morbidity, hospitalization, and poor renal  prognosis. Low education and the lack of money are identified as the main barrier  to improve lupus prognosis. Newer therapeutic agents and new protocols had  contributed to improve survival in SLE. The use of corticoid-sparing agents  (hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetif) is one  of the most useful strategy; availability of inexpensive generics may help to  optimize access to these medications.

T1  - Prevention and management of co-morbidities in SLE.
SP  - e187-95
AB  - The prognosis and survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  have improved over the past few decades. The major cause of death is no longer  active lupus, but instead cardiovascular disease, complications of renal failure,  and malignancy. Co-morbid factors, including both traditional and non-traditional  cardiovascular risk factors, can be targeted according to accepted guidelines. We  will emphasize the deleterious effect of corticosteroids in contributing to  cardiovascular risk and the need to shift maintenance prednisone doses to a much  lower threshold.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of rituximab in the treatment of non-renal systemic lupus 
SP  - 175-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the efficacy and safety of rituximab in the treatment of  non-renal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We systematically searched  MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to June  2013. The following were the selection criteria: (1) adult patients with SLE, (2)  rituximab treatment, (3) placebo or active comparator, (4) outcome measures  assessing efficacy and/or (5) safety. Meta-analysis, systematic literature  reviews, randomised control trials (RCT), open clinical trials and cohort studies  were included. Independent extraction of articles by 2 authors using predefined  data fields was performed. The quality of each study was graded using the Oxford  Levels of Evidence and Jadad's scale. RESULTS: A total of 26 articles met our  inclusion criteria: one RCT and its exploratory analysis, 2 open studies and 22  cohort studies, which analysed 1,231 patients. Overall, patients had active  disease refractory to steroids and/or immunosuppressant drugs. Acceptable  evidence suggested improvements in disease activity, arthritis,  thrombocytopaenia, complement and anti-dsDNA, with a steroid-sparing effect. But  relapses of disease were demonstrated too. Weak evidence suggested a response in  anaemia, cutaneous and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Available evidence  revealed few major adverse events. Studies had medium methodological quality and  in general were applicable to current practice. CONCLUSION: Rituximab has been  shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of non-renal SLE, especially in  terms of disease activity, immunologic parameters and steroid-sparing effect.  However, it can only be recommended for organ-specific manifestations such as  arthritis and thrombocytopaenia. High-quality studies are needed in order to  consider the long-term effects of re-treatment on different organ-specific  manifestations.

T1  - Synovitis with pitting edema as the presenting manifestation of systemic lupus 
SP  - 1069-72
AB  - Rheumatologists are increasingly aware of the entity synovitis with pitting  edema. The remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema  (RS3PE) syndrome has been reported with an array of conditions that include  polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriatic  arthropathy. Synovitis with pitting edema is now being increasingly recognized  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report a patient who presented with  edema of hands and feet and was diagnosed eventually with definite SLE. With  magnetic resonance imaging, joint effusions and tenosynovitis were confirmed to  be associated with the otherwise-unexplained extremity edema.

T1  - Arthritis and diagnosis of leprosy: a case report and review of the literature.
SP  - 323-5
AB  - Leprosy is clinically characterized by involvement of peripheral nerves and skin.  The immunological profile of the individual defines the diversity of clinical  manifestations, from skin disorders to systemic manifestations, especially the  articulation ones, common in multibacillary forms, which may mimic collagen  diseases and often posing diagnostic difficulties in endemic areas. This is a  case report of asymmetric polyarthritis of small and large articulations  associated with skin lesions which had been treated by a rheumatologist for 2  years with initial clinical diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, and later, with  the appearance of skin lesions, of systemic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - Environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and the risk of lupus.
SP  - 568-76
AB  - A dose-dependent combination of environmental exposures, estrogenic hormones and  genetic predisposition is thought to be required for lupus to develop and flare,  but how the environment modifies the immune system in genetically predisposed  people is unclear. Current evidence indicates that environmental agents that  inhibit DNA methylation can convert normal antigen-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes  into autoreactive, cytotoxic, pro-inflammatory cells that are sufficient to cause  lupus-like autoimmunity in animal models, and that the same changes in DNA  methylation characterize CD4+ T cells from patients with active lupus.  Environmental agents implicated in inhibiting T-cell DNA methylation include the  lupus-inducing drugs procainamide and hydralazine, as well as diet, and agents  causing oxidative stress, such as smoking, UV light exposure, and infections,  which have been associated with lupus onset or disease activity. Other studies  demonstrate that demethylated T cells cause only anti-DNA antibodies in mice  lacking a genetic predisposition to lupus, but are sufficient to cause lupus-like  autoimmunity in genetically predisposed mice and likely people, and that  estrogens augment the disease. Collectively, these studies suggest that  environmental agents that inhibit DNA methylation, together with lupus genes and  estrogens or endocrine disruptors, combine in a dose-dependent fashion to cause  lupus flares.

T1  - The effects of lupus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome on foetal outcomes.
SP  - 507-17
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ autoimmune disease that  primarily affects women of childbearing-age. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a  systemic autoimmune disorder defined by the occurrence of venous and arterial  thrombosis, often multiple, and pregnancy morbidity in the presence of  antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Recently, the long-term outcome of children  born to patients with lupus and APS has become a major topic of interest both to  patients and physicians. One of the major problems related to maternal disease is  preterm delivery with all the consequences that this condition may bring.  Prematurity may also be due to the presence of aPL; however, aPL do not generally  display any thrombotic potential on neonates. Another complication may be  neonatal lupus (NL), mediated by the presence of maternal antibodies (anti-Ro/SSA  and anti-La/SSB). In addition, behaviour and neuropsychological outcomes have  also been a matter of interest, but there are currently few data available.  Beyond the biological influence of both maternal disease and autoimmune  background, it is important to focus on the possible influence of maternal  chronic illness on the neuropsychological development of her children. Whether  aPL exposure could have a direct effect on brain development is still being  debated. In children of mothers with APS, language delays have been noted and  learning disabilities were described with a higher rate than the general  age-school population. Several studies were performed on children born to lupus  mothers: even if maternal lupus does not seem to impair intelligence levels, it  may increase the occurrence of learning disabilities and particularly dyslexia in  male children. To the best of our knowledge, no studies are available on the  long-term outcome of children born to mothers with lupus or APS and particularly  regarding the development of autoimmune diseases. Nevertheless, common experience  of experts in the field is that these children do not show a significantly  increased risk of displaying the same autoimmune disease as their mothers. The  purpose of this paper is to answer the frequently asked questions of patients  with lupus and APS who desire to become mothers, based on the little information  available.

T1  - Effects of exercise on depressive symptoms in adults with arthritis and other 
SP  - 121
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a major public health problem among adults with  arthritis and other rheumatic disease. The purpose of this study was to conduct a  systematic review of previous meta-analyses addressing the effects of exercise  (aerobic, strength or both) on depressive symptoms in adults with osteoarthritis,  rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia and systemic lupus erythematous. METHODS:  Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were included by searching  nine electronic databases and cross-referencing. Methodological quality was  assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Instrument.  Random-effects models that included the standardized mean difference (SMD) and  95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. The alpha value for statistical  significance was set at p </= 0.05. The U3 index, number needed to treat (NNT) and  number of US people who could benefit were also calculated. RESULTS: Of the 95  citations initially identified, two aggregate data meta-analyses representing 6  and 19 effect sizes in as many as 870 fibromyalgia participants were included.  Methodological quality was 91% and 82%, respectively. Exercise minus control  group reductions in depressive symptoms were found for both meta-analyses (SMD,  -0.61, 95% CI, -0.99 to -0.23, p = 0.002; SMD, -0.32, 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.12,  p = 0.002). Percentile improvements (U3) were equivalent to 22.9 and 12.6. The  number needed to treat was 6 and 9 with an estimated 0.83 and 0.56 million US  people with fibromyalgia potentially benefitting. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise improves  depressive symptoms in adults with fibromyalgia. However, a need exists for  additional meta-analytic work on this topic.

T1  - Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. 
SP  - 248-53
AB  - Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  is a rare but potentially fatal condition. Although the pathogenesis of this  condition is unknown, high disease activity is the main characteristic; moreover,  histopathology in some studies showed alveolar immune complex deposits and  capillaritis. Clinical features of DAH include dyspnea, a drop in hemoglobin, and  diffuse radiographic alveolar images, with or without hemoptysis. Factors  associated with mortality include mechanical ventilation, renal failure, and  infections. Bacterial infections have been reported frequently in patients with  DAH, but also invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis. DAH treatment  is based on high dose methylprednisolone; other accepted therapies include  cyclophosphamide (controversial), plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin and rituximab.

T1  - FCGR3B copy number loss rather than gain is a risk factor for systemic lupus 
SP  - 392-7
AB  - AIM: Some studies have been performed to elucidate the association between Fc  gamma receptor 3B (FCGR3B) copy number (CN) and the risk of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and/or lupus nephritis (LN), yet the results remain  conflicting. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic review of all the studies  published and carried out a meta-analysis to obtain a better understanding of the  role of FCGR3B CN in the susceptibility of SLE and LN. METHOD: A computerized  literature search was conducted in databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge for  all studies investigating the association between FCGR3B CN and SLE and/or LN,  published up to May 2013. RESULTS: A total of six articles meeting all of the  criteria were included in this study. There were five comparisons of SLE between  2490 patients and 4286 controls, and four comparisons of LN between 689 patients  and 1924 controls. Our results showed that individuals with FCGR3B CN gain did  not suffer an increased risk of SLE or LN as compared to the normal genotype in  the total analysis (SLE: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.79-1.45, P = 0.65; LN: OR = 0.83,  95% CI = 0.47-1.46, P = 0.52). However, individuals with FCGR3B CN loss exhibited  an increased risk of SLE or LN (SLE: OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.51-2.06, P < 0.00001;  LN: OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.59-2.57, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis  indicated that FCGR3B CN loss rather than CN gain was associated with  susceptibility to SLE and LN.

T1  - Neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic 
SP  - 494-501
AB  - Herein we summarize the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of  neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). We performed a systematic review of the neuro-ophthalmologic  manifestations of SLE reported in the English literature from 1970 to 2010 by a  Medline search. The prevalence of neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations is 3.6% in  adult and 1.6% in childhood SLE patients. Neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of  SLE are highly variable, with the commonest presentation being optic neuritis,  followed by myasthenia gravis, visual field defects and pseudotumor cerebri. The  underlying pathology was thought to be either SLE activity or its vascular  complications. Most neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are responsive to  high-dose glucocorticoids. Anticoagulation is indicated when there is concomitant  antiphospholipid syndrome. SLE-related neuromyelitis optica is often refractory  to treatment and 92% of patients require multiple immunosuppressive protocols.  Neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations of SLE are uncommon but heterogeneous. The  prognosis of neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations in SLE is generally good because  of their rapid response to glucocorticoids. Relapses of these manifestations may  be reduced by the use of maintenance immunosuppression. Cyclophosphamide,  azathioprine, plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab can be  considered in glucocorticoid-dependent or refractory cases. Anticoagulation is  indicated when there is concomitant antiphospholipid syndrome.

T1  - Diverse vascular lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus and clinical 
SP  - 218-23
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vascular injury is one of the typical symptoms of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), and may play a key role in the choice of treatment  strategy and prediction of prognosis. In this review, diverse vascular lesions in  SLE and their clinical significance are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: The clinical  features of vascular disease in SLE differ from organ to organ, and may be  extreme with regard to renal vascular lesions. Vascular lesions in SLE may be of  inflammatory or thrombotic origin, and immune system dysfunction is considered to  be a predominant feature. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the activation  and injury of endothelial cells might play a key role in the pathogenesis.  SUMMARY: Vascular lesions in SLE are mediated by a complex interaction between  the immune system and other contributing factors. Different therapies developed  for vascular lesions, both immunosuppressive and nonimmunosuppressive, should be  selected based on the different clinical and pathological characteristics, and  our future understanding of the different mechanisms involved.

T1  - Pulmonary manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 249-54
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic inflammatory disease,  characterized serologically by an autoantibody response to nucleic antigens, and  clinically by injury and/or malfunction in any organ system. During their disease  course, up to 50% of SLE patients will develop lung disease. Pulmonary  manifestations of SLE include pleuritis (with or without effusion), inflammatory  and fibrotic forms of interstitial lung disease, alveolar hemorrhage, shrinking  lung syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, airways disease, and thromboembolic  disease. Two major themes inform our understanding of SLE-associated pulmonary  manifestations: first, the presence of specific autoantibodies correlates with  the presence of certain pulmonary manifestations and second, vascular injury  marks a common pathophysiologic thread among the various SLE-related lung  diseases. This review will focus on the clinical presentation, pathogenesis,  pathology, management, and prognosis of these SLE-associated lung conditions.

T1  - Increased risk of high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in 
SP  - 730-5
AB  - Conflicting data have been published regarding the risk of cervical lesions among  women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We systematically reviewed the  evidence for an association of SLE with cervical precancerous lesions (high-grade  squamous intraepithelial lesions, HSIL), and performed a meta-analysis to  determine the risk of HSIL in SLE patients. Observational studies identified up  to February 2013 from the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were selected if  they assessed the prevalence of HSIL in female SLE patients versus healthy female  controls and included in a meta-analysis with pooled effect estimates obtained  using a random-effects model. Of 235 citations retrieved, 7 studies met inclusion  criteria. The pooled odds ratio for the risk of HSIL in SLE patients (n=416)  versus female controls (n=11,408) was 8.66 (95% CI: 3.75-20.00), without  significant heterogeneity across studies. Cumulative meta-analysis according to  year of study publication revealed a slight increase in the risk of HSIL in the  2001-2011 period and then a stabilization afterwards. This meta-analysis shows  that the risk of HSIL is significantly increased in SLE patients, compared to  healthy female controls. This suggests that women with SLE may benefit from HPV  vaccines and specific cervical cancer screening.

T1  - Systematic review of the quality of prognosis studies in systemic lupus 
SP  - 1536-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prognosis studies examine outcomes and/or seek to identify predictors  or factors associated with outcomes. Many prognostic factors have been identified  in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but few have been consistently found  across studies. We hypothesized that this is due to a lack of rigor of study  designs. This study aimed to systematically assess the methodologic quality of  prognosis studies in SLE. METHODS: A search of prognosis studies in SLE was  performed using MEDLINE and Embase, from January 1990 to June 2011. A  representative sample of 150 articles was selected using a random number  generator and assessed by 2 reviewers. Each study was assessed by a risk of bias  tool according to 6 domains: study participation, study attrition, measurement of  prognostic factors, measurement of outcomes, measurement/adjustment for  confounders, and appropriateness of statistical analysis. Information about  missing data was also collected. RESULTS: A cohort design was used in 71% of  studies. High risk of bias was found in 65% of studies for confounders, 57% for  study participation, 56% for attrition, 36% for statistical analyses, 20% for  prognostic factors, and 18% for outcome. Missing covariate or outcome information  was present in half of the studies. Only 6 studies discussed reasons for missing  data and 2 imputed missing data. CONCLUSION: Lack of rigorous study design,  especially in addressing confounding, study participation and attrition, and  inadequately handled missing data, has limited the quality of prognosis studies  in SLE. Future prognosis studies should be designed with consideration of these  factors to improve methodologic rigor.

T1  - Oxidative stress and its biomarkers in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 23
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease whose  etiology remains largely unknown. The uncontrolled oxidative stress in SLE  contributes to functional oxidative modifications of cellular protein, lipid and  DNA and consequences of oxidative modification play a crucial role in  immunomodulation and trigger autoimmunity. Measurements of oxidative modified  protein, lipid and DNA in biological samples from SLE patients may assist in the  elucidation of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the oxidative stress-related  damage, the prediction of disease prognosis and the selection of adequate  treatment in the early stage of disease. Application of these biomarkers in  disease may indicate the early effectiveness of the therapy. This review is  intended to provide an overview of various reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed  during the state of disease and their biomarkers linking with disease. The first  part of the review presents biochemistry and pathophysiology of ROS and  antioxidant system in disease. The second part of the review discusses the recent  development of oxidative stress biomarkers that relates pathogenesis in SLE  patients and animal model. Finally, this review also describes the reported  clinical trials of antioxidant in the disease that have evaluated the efficacy of  antioxidant in the management of disease with ongoing conventional therapy.

T1  - Tuberculous pyomyositis: a re-emerging entity of many faces.
SP  - 1105-10
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) has become a global concern due to its increasing incidence,  particularly in immunocompromised patients, closely following the migratory  patterns of populations. TB pyomyositis is a rare extrapulmonary manifestation of  TB. Its clinical presentation varies and requires a high degree of suspicion for  early diagnosis. We present three patients diagnosed with TB pyomyositis: a  46-year-old man with dermatomyositis (DM) and hepatitis B who presented with  fever, muscle weakness, and an abscess at the right proximal arm; a 71-year-old  immunocompetent male, with a past medical history of tuberculous lymphadenopathy  in childhood, who presented with a 2-month history of fever and pain at the right  thigh, and a 44-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on  prednisone and methotrexate who presented with skin eruption at her thighs  mimicking lupus panniculitis. In all three patients, Mycobacterium tuberculosis  was identified as the causative agent. The lack of specific signs, the false  negative tuberculin skin test in some cases, and the unfamiliarity of many  clinicians with this entity can cause diagnostic delays. Prompt diagnosis  requires a high index of suspicion especially in immunocompromised patients with  fever.

T1  - Possible novel biomarkers of organ involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1025-31
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by excessive production of  various autoantibodies, which play important roles in the pathogenesis of SLE.  Apart from classical autoantibodies such as anti-double stranded DNA antibody  (anti-dsDNA), anti-Smith antibody (anti-Sm), and anti-phospholipid antibody  (APL), recent studies focus on some novel autoantibodies including  anti-complement (C) 1q antibody (anti-C1q), which is closely correlated with  lupus nephritis; anti-N-methyl-D-asparate receptor antibody (NMDAR), which  mediates neuropsychiatric manifestations in SLE to some extent; anti-galectin,  which is involved in secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) in SLE; and  anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), which represents a more specific biomarker for  subclinical ovarian damage caused by the disease itself or cytotoxic drugs in SLE  patients. Correlation of these autoantibodies with disease activity and organ  involvement of SLE may help to evaluate disease severity, efficacy of treatment,  and long-term prognosis. Furthermore, combined measurement of a variety of  autoantibodies is supposed to be more valuable in estimating disease activity and  severity.

T1  - Update on B-cell targeted therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 773-88
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease  characterized by flares and remission, leading to accrual of organ damage over  time as a result of persistent tissue inflammation and treatment-related  complications. Novel therapies aiming at better treatment response and fewer  adverse effects are being tested in the pipeline. AREAS COVERED: This review  summarizes the B-cell abnormalities observed in patients with SLE, and updates  recent data on the efficacy and safety of B-cell targeted therapies in the  treatment of SLE. The pitfalls of clinical trial design and future directions of  the development of SLE therapeutics are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: The  variability of clinical response to treatment in SLE reflects the clinical and  immunological heterogeneity of the disease. The treatment plan for patients with  SLE should be individualized with the aim of eradicating disease activity,  preventing flares and minimizing treatment-related complications. Despite the  disappointment of recent clinical trials, B-cell remains the promising target of  future SLE therapies. Results from ongoing clinical trials on B-cell targeted  biological agents are eagerly awaited.

T1  - Drug-induced lupus: Including anti-tumour necrosis factor and interferon induced.
SP  - 545-53
AB  - Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is defined as a syndrome with clinical and  serological features similar to systemic lupus erythematosus that is temporally  related to continuous drug exposure and which resolves after discontinuation of  this drug. More than 90 drugs, including biological modulators such as tumour  necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and interferons, have been identified as likely  'culprits'. While there are no standard diagnostic criteria for drug-induced  lupus erythematosus, guidelines that can help to distinguish drug-induced lupus  erythematosus from systemic lupus erythematosus have been proposed and several  different patterns of drug-induced lupus erythematosus are emerging.  Distinguishing drug-induced lupus erythematosus from systemic lupus erythematosus  is important because the prognosis of drug-induced lupus erythematosus is usually  good when the drug is withdrawn. This review discusses the differences between  drug-induced lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus, the mechanisms  of action of drug-induced lupus erythematosus and drugs that are usually  associated with drug-induced lupus erythematosus, with particular focus on the  biological treatments.

T1  - Antiphospholipid syndrome in renal transplantation.
SP  - 177-85
AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) may occur in isolation or in association with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with the potential to cause renal failure via  several distinct pathologies. Renal transplantation in the presence of APS  carries a risk of early graft loss from arterial or venous thrombosis, or  thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Whilst perioperative anticoagulation reduces  the risk of large vessel thrombosis, it may result in significant haemorrhage,  and its efficacy in preventing post-transplant TMA is uncertain. Here, we report  a patient with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to lupus nephritis and APS, in  whom allograft TMA developed soon after transplantation despite partial  anticoagulation. TMA resolved with plasma exchange-based therapy albeit with some  irreversible graft damage and renal impairment. We discuss the differential  diagnosis of post-transplant TMA, and current treatment options.

T1  - In-/off-label use of biologic therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 30
AB  - Current therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include corticosteroids  as a persistent mainstay and traditional immunosuppressants which are given  according to disease severity, organ involvement and patient status. No treatment  entails certain efficacy devoid of mild-to-moderate adverse effects. Nowadays,  novel therapies are being developed aiming to target specific molecules involved  in SLE development and progression which show variable effectiveness and safety.  Biologic agents considered for SLE comprise monoclonal antibodies (chimeric,  humanized or fully human) as well as fusion molecules or antibody fragments  mostly consisting of B cell-targeted therapies beside anti-cytokines as well as T  cell-targeted therapies. Encouraging evidence on biologics is mostly provided by  case series or uncontrolled studies; conversely, larger randomized controlled  clinical trials have frequently missed their primary endpoints with the exception  of BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials. Actually, apart from belimumab, biologics are  employed in clinical practice as off-label treatments for lupus and results are  often promising, depending on specific SLE features, dose regimens and individual  responsiveness.

T1  - Diagnosis and management of neuropsychiatric SLE.
SP  - 338-47
AB  - Nervous system involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can manifest as  a range of neurological and psychiatric features, which are classified using the  ACR case definitions for 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes. Approximately one-third  of all neuropsychiatric syndromes in patients with SLE are primary manifestations  of SLE-related autoimmunity, with seizure disorders, cerebrovascular disease,  acute confusional state and neuropathy being the most common. Such primary  neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) events are a consequence either of microvasculopathy  and thrombosis, or of autoantibodies and inflammatory mediators. Diagnosis of  NPSLE requires the exclusion of other causes, and clinical assessment directs the  selection of appropriate investigations. These investigations include measurement  of autoantibodies, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, electrophysiological studies,  neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging to evaluate brain structure and  function. Treatment involves the management of comorbidities contributing to the  neuropsychiatric event, use of symptomatic therapies, and more specific  interventions with either anticoagulation or immunosuppressive agents, depending  upon the primary immunopathogenetic mechanism. Although the prognosis is  variable, studies suggest a more favourable outcome for primary NPSLE  manifestations compared with neuropsychiatric events attributable to non-SLE  causes.

T1  - Lupus clinical development: will belimumab's approval catalyse a new paradigm for 
SP  - 491-501
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a diverse autoimmune disease  affecting many different organ systems. Although disease manifestations are  varied across the lupus population, the widespread presence of autoantibodies  indicates that SLE immunopathology involves B-cell dysregulation. Belimumab, a  human anti-B-cell activating factor (BLyS) monoclonal antibody, was invented by  Human Genome Sciences and co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline and became, in 2011,  the first new therapy approved for SLE patients in over 50 years. AREAS COVERED:  Belimumab approval represents a milestone as a new treatment for a subset of SLE  patients and also a window onto the continued unmet need for many patients  suffering from this diverse disease. This paper analyses the drugs and clinical  trials of industry-sponsored development programs to profile the current SLE  landscape and to consider how belimumab is shaping the future of SLE drug  development. EXPERT OPINION: Our analysis demonstrates that the belimumab  clinical program created a model for improvements in study designs that is  reflected in ongoing clinical trials sponsored by a broad range of companies.  Additional BLyS inhibitors, with distinctive targeting characteristics, are now  in late stage development. A broad range of drugs with other mechanisms of action  are also under investigation in Phase II - III trials, some of which are focused  on the underserved lupus nephritis population.

T1  - Optimizing outcome in SLE: treating-to-target and definition of treatment goals.
SP  - 770-7
AB  - Patients affected with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) display poor-long term  prognosis and increased mortality in respect of general population. This may be  due to continuous organ damage accrual which is fostered both by persistent  disease activity (mainly in the short term) and prolonged corticosteroid exposure  (mainly in the long term). The effort of defining novel therapeutic goals to  which patients should be treated in order to have their prognosis improved is  named treat-to-target. Remission in SLE was shown to be associated with better  outcome and prolonged survival; in clinical practice, patients may experience  either complete or clinical remission, which are defined as complete  clinical/serological healing or no clinical signs of lupus with active serology,  respectively. The main treat-to-target in SLE is complete remission, however  since longitudinal observations suggest that clinical remission or low disease  activity even with minimal corticosteroid intake do improve patients prognosis  and survival as well, they may be assumed as acceptable alternative targets.  Suitable therapeutic strategies have to be defined in order for these goals to be  achieved including early diagnosis, effective treatment and proper corticosteroid  tapering which in turn require development of more reliable serum biomarkers for  early disease detection and less toxic targeted therapies with a steroid-sparing  potential.

T1  - The diagnosis and classification of mixed connective tissue disease.
SP  - 46-9
AB  - The term "mixed connective tissue disease" (MCTD) concerns a systemic autoimmune  disease typified by overlapping features between two or more systemic autoimmune  diseases and the presence of antibodies against the U1 small nuclear  ribonucleoprotein autoantigen (U1snRNP). Since the first description of this  condition in 1972, the understanding of clinical manifestations and long-term  outcome of MCTD have significantly advanced. Polyarthritis, Raynaud's phenomenon,  puffy fingers, lung involvement and esophageal dysmotility are the most  frequently reported symptoms among the different cohorts during the course of the  disease. Moreover, in recent years a growing interest has been focused on severe  organ involvement such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and interstitial lung  disease which can accrue during the long-term follow-up and can still  significantly influence disease prognosis. Over the last years, significant  advances have been made also in disease pathogenesis understanding and a central  pathogenetic role of anti-U1RNP autoantibodies has clearly emerged. Although  controversies on disease definition and classification still persist, MCTD  identifies a group of patients in whom increased surveillance for specific  manifestations and prognostic stratification became mandatory to improve  patient's outcomes.

T1  - Lung, liver, prostate, bladder malignancies risk in systemic lupus erythematosus: 
SP  - 284-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to examine some solid tumors incidence  in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) derived from population-based  cohort studies by means of meta-analysis. METHODS: Relevant electronic databases  were searched for studies characterizing the associated risk of overall  malignancy and four site-specific malignancies (lung, liver, prostate, bladder  cancer) in patients with SLE. The meta-analysis procedure was used to pool  standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to  evaluate the association. RESULTS: A total of seven cohort studies were  identified, of which six provided the SIR for overall malignancy, seven reported  the SIR for lung cancer, five for liver cancer, four for prostate cancer and six  for bladder cancer. Overall, lung and liver cancers were more frequently observed  in patients with SLE with SIR of 1.16 (95% CI = 1.12-1.21), 1.68 (95%  CI = 1.33-2.13) and 2.44 (95% CI = 1.46-4.05), respectively. However, the risk of  prostate cancer appeared to be somewhat reduced in male patients with SLE  (SIR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that SLE  patients are at increased risk of developing cancer, particularly of the lung,  bladder and liver. However, males with SLE have a decreased risk of prostate  cancer.

SP  - 118-23
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review synthesizes new data from the studies published  between 2011 and 2013, with particular focus on the different information gleaned  by various study types. RECENT FINDINGS: Population-based cohorts have  demonstrated that women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have fewer live  births and more pregnancy complications, but can have successful live births  after having a poor outcome. A retrospective study suggests that only 4 months,  not the traditional 6 months of disease quiescent SLE prior to pregnancy improves  outcomes. Prospective studies identified several novel predictors of poor  pregnancy outcomes, including uterine Doppler and laboratory findings. A  prospective study found great success in transitioning to azathioprine from  mycophenolate mofetil prior to pregnancy in patients with quiet lupus nephritis.  Two retrospective analyses suggest that hydroxychloroquine may prevent congenital  heart block in pregnancies exposed to SSA/Ro antibodies. Finally, the initial  pregnancy data for belimumab suggest a high degree of transplacental transfer,  but thus far no definitive link between belimumab and congenital abnormalities.  SUMMARY: Recent studies suggest both novel markers of poor pregnancy outcomes and  new approaches to the management of lupus during pregnancy.

SP  - 225-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to evaluate the evidence for efficacy  of methotrexate (MTX) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A  comprehensive, computerized search was performed in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and  the Cochrane Controlled Trials registry to screen for studies that examined the  efficacy of MTX in adult SLE patients. The Jadad scoring system was used to  assess study quality, and data were pooled using the random effects model.  RESULTS: Of the 53 articles that were identified, 44 were excluded. Nine studies  (including three randomized controlled and six observational) were eligible for  inclusion. All of the included studies predominantly involved patients with  arthritis or mucocutaneous features. There was significant reduction of the SLE  Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) among MTX-treated patients when compared with  controls (p = 0.001, odds ratio (OR) 0.444, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.279 to  0.707). There was also significant reduction in the average dose of  corticosteroids among MTX-treated patients when compared with controls  (p = 0.001, OR 0.335, 95% CI 0.202 to 0.558). The effect of MTX on laboratory and  serological markers, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-dsDNA and  complement levels (C3 and C4), could not be determined because of the limited  numbers of controlled trials. CONCLUSION: The use of MTX is associated with  significant reductions in SLEDAI and the average dose of corticosteroids in adult  patients with SLE.

T1  - Recent developments in the treatment of patients with systemic lupus 
SP  - 311-26
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Major trials hoping to obtain optimal disease control in systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) are ongoing. Given its complex aetiology and  pathogenesis, it is not surprising that multiple therapeutic targets have emerged  and that none are uniformly successful. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we  highlight the recent, more significant studies focusing on the use of biologic  therapies. There has been great emphasis on the role of B cells in SLE and many  uncontrolled studies have encouraged the use of rituximab (an anti-CD20  monoclonal). Disappointingly, two major trials, EXPLORER and LUNAR did not  confirm its utility, although doubts have been expressed on their trial design,  and other trials using this drug are commencing. In contrast, belimumab, which  blocks a B-cell activating factor, did meet its end points in two major  randomised controlled clinical trials and has been approved for use in SLE by  both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Encouraging, albeit preliminary,  results with epratuzumab (which blocks CD22) have also been reported. EXPERT  OPINION: In addition to targeting B cells, other approaches including biologics,  which modulate T-cell function and block interleukin-6 and interferon-alpha, have  been explored. Finally, we review the recent developments in the use of  conventional drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate.

T1  - Hepatic manifestations in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 36-40
AB  - Juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by multisystem involvement and diverse clinical and serological  manifestations. Clinically significant hepatic disease is generally regarded as  unusual in JSLE, but many studies have showed that hepatic disease may be more  common in SLE than was usually thought. Hepatic disease does not cause  significant morbidity and mortality, but subclinical liver involvement is common.  One of the hepatic disorders associated with JSLE is autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).  The precise etiology of AIH and JSLE remains unknown, however both AIH and JSLE  are associated with antinuclear antibody (ANA) and multisystem disease  manifestations. A shared immunologic response and genetic predisposition were  suggested. Recently, new approaches for treatment of SLE and recent patents that  could develop into novel therapeutic agents in clinical management of SLE have  been proposed. An array of promising new therapies is currently emerging or being  developed including B-cell depletion therapies, agents targeting B-cell survival  factors, blockade of T-cell co-stimulation and present review, we will also  report the case of a 12-year old girl who developed JSLE four years after her  preliminary diagnosis with AIH.

T1  - Overview of lupus nephritis management guidelines and perspective from Asia.
SP  - 625-36
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and important manifestation of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). Evidence suggests higher rates of lupus renal involvement in  Asian populations, and maybe more severe nephritis, compared with other racial or  ethnic groups. The management of LN has evolved considerably over the past three  decades, based on observations from clinical studies that investigated different  immunosuppressive agents including corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide,  azathioprine, mycophenolic acid, calcineurin inhibitors and novel biologic  therapies. This is accompanied by improvements in both the short-term treatment  response rate and long-term renal function preservation. Treatment guidelines for  LN have recently been issued by rheumatology and nephrology communities in U.S.A.  and Europe. In view of the racial difference in disease manifestation and  response to therapy, and the substantial disease burden in Asia, a panel of 15  nephrologists and rheumatologists from different Asian regions with extensive  experience in lupus nephritis - the Steering Group for the Asian Lupus Nephritis  Network (ALNN) - met and discussed the management of lupus nephritis in Asian  patients. The group has also reviewed and deliberated on the recently published  recommendations from other parts of the world. This manuscript summarizes the  discussions by the group and presents consensus views on the clinical management  and treatment of adult Asian patients with LN, taking into account both the  available evidence and expert opinion in areas where evidence remains to be  sought.

T1  - Maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis with mycophenolate or azathioprine: 
SP  - 834-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to summarize the comparative efficacy  and safety of MMF and AZA as maintenance therapy for LN. METHODS: Systematic  review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of MMF and AZA as  maintenance therapy for LN were performed based on a sensitive search.  Meta-regression was used to explore causes of heterogeneity. Safety was explored  using crude and combined incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of the more frequent  adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: The search produced 7341 hits. Four randomized  clinical trials and one long-term study were selected for detailed analysis. No  significant differences between MMF and AZA were found in sustained remission,  relapse, renal failure, creatinine increase or death. However, there was high  heterogeneity in the design of studies, drug doses and treatment in the previous  induction phase. Significant lower rates of discontinuation due to AEs occurred  in the MMF group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41, 0.88) but  significant risk of publication bias (Egger test, P = 0.012). Gastrointestinal  manifestations were more common [combined IRR 1.68 (95% CI 1.06, 2.68)] and  leucopoenia less frequent in the MMF group [combined IRR 0.14 (95% CI 0.05,  0.42)]. CONCLUSION: The available data does not support the superiority of MMF or  AZA as maintenance therapy for LN. Nevertheless, the high heterogeneity of  studies included in the analysis makes this contention questionable.

T1  - Severe pulmonary hypertension as the initial manifestation of systemic lupus 
SP  - 267-74
AB  - Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is rarely observed as the initial  manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the diagnosis is often  delayed. Here we present the case of a 32-year-old woman with severe PAH as the  initial manifestation of SLE, who was successfully treated with mycophenolate  mofetil and cyclosporine. This case offered the opportunity to critically review  the epidemiology data, predictive markers, and pathogenic pathways of  SLE-associated PAH (SLE-PAH) in relation to the currently available therapeutic  options and to the main clinical trials of the last 10 years focused on the  treatment of SLE-PAH. Mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine - currently used in  the maintenance phase of the disease in certain clinical settings - should be  considered, as an alternative to cyclophosphamide, in future clinical trials  aimed at evaluating the most effective treatment of SLE-PAH at presentation.

T1  - Refractory hemophagocytic syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus successfully 
SP  - 281-6
AB  - We experienced three patients with refractory or severe hemophagocytic syndrome  associated with the activity of systemic lupus erythematosus, so-called acute  lupus hemophagocytic syndrome (ALHS). All patients were successfully treated with  intermittent intravenous injections of cyclophosphamide (IVCY). In each patient,  hemophagocytosis was found during bone marrow examination, and infectious causes  of hemophagocytic syndrome were carefully excluded. Patients 1 and 2 were  refractory to combination therapy with a high-dose corticosteroid and rituximab  or cyclosporine and were successfully treated with additive IVCY. Patient 3 had  very severe ALHS that developed after cardiac surgery but was successfully  treated with a high-dose corticosteroid and IVCY. We conducted a literature  review of adult ALHS and analyzed 54 cases reported from 2006 to 2013. Although  the clinical and laboratory features were diverse, fever, bicytopenia or  pancytopenia, and hyperferritinemia were almost universal. Including our 3  patients, a total of 16 have reportedly been treated with IVCY-containing  regimens, and ALHS was successfully controlled in most of them without switching  or adding other therapies. We suggest that combination therapy with IVCY and  corticosteroids may be useful to treat severe or refractory ALHS.

T1  - Tubulointerstitial nephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus: innocent bystander 
SP  - 553-65
AB  - SLE-associated tubulointerstitial injury (SLE TIN) is increasingly recognized in  two forms, i.e., secondary and primary. The secondary form coexists with lupus  glomerulonephritis, whereas the primary form develops against the background of  no or mild glomerular or vascular involvement. Secondary SLE TIN is frequent, but  its frequency and severity correlate with the class of the associated lupus  glomerulonephritis (GN), being almost universal in Class IV lupus GN and less  frequent in GN of other classes. Although the presence of underlying GN may mask  its clinical manifestation, secondary SLE TIN has a major prognostic implication  for the renal outcome. Yet, SLE TIN is not factored in the current  therapy-focused International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society  schema of renal lupus classification, and its management remains to be  elucidated. The pathogenesis of secondary SLE TIN is either immunologic, i.e.,  the tubulointerstitial injury being mediated by SLE-related immunologic  mechanisms akin to those responsible for lupus GN; or non-immunologic, i.e., a  nonspecific tubulointerstitial injury secondary to any type of advanced  glomerular lesion, regardless of etiology. Primary SLE TIN is rare with about 15  reported cases. It has a rather uniform and distinctive clinical manifestation  including acute kidney injury with no or mild proteinuria. It responds well to  steroid and usually carries a good prognosis. Its pathogenesis is almost certain  immunologic, with immunoglobulin/complement deposits along the tubular basement  membrane in each reported case. In spite of these profound clinical implications,  the current review underlies a limited knowledge on the pathobiology of SLE TIN.

T1  - Pulmonary hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 425-34
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with several forms of pulmonary  hypertension. It can cause pulmonary hypertension through pulmonary  thromboembolic disease, left heart disease and lung disease as well as causing an  isolated pulmonary vasculopathy called pulmonary arterial hypertension. The true  prevalence of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with lupus is not known  but probably is no more than 1%. Currently, treatment for lupus-associated  pulmonary arterial hypertension is with pulmonary vasodilators including  phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists and prostacyclin  analogues, as it is for other causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Case  series suggest there may be a special role for immunosuppression in this rare  group of patients. We present two brief case histories and summarise our  experience over 15 years. Prognosis is better in lupus-associated pulmonary  arterial hypertension than in systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial  hypertension, but unfortunately it remains a fatal condition in most patients.

SP  - 319-28
AB  - Despite decades of clinical research aimed at finding the most appropriate  immunosuppressive regime, lupus nephritis (LN) remains one of the major disease  manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a great impact on  survival and quality of life. We start this review by defining the disease  burden, the real-world challenges and the poor prognostic factors. We then  discuss the current anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and biologic therapies, with  special emphasis on the need for optimal global care.

SP  - 580-6
AB  - Physicians in practice should be knowledgeable regarding several aspects of  autoimmune disorders, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus  nephritis. These disorders can present to the clinician's clinic and private  office regardless of their specialty. This review will discuss various aspects of  SLE, its mechanisms of disease, role of accelerated atherosclerosis,  proinflammatory cytokines, and therapeutic approaches. The role of vascular  endothelial growth factor in which and plasma levels have been associated with  disease activity, classification of severity, and diagnosis of lupus nephritis is  addressed. Current treatment options, prognosis, and future therapeutic  approaches and common side effects are also discussed.

T1  - Intentional overdose of azathioprine in a patient with systemic lupus 
SP  - e3-4
AB  - A 14-year-old girl with systemic lupus erythematosus presented with a mixed  overdose of paracetamol, ibuprofen and azathioprine (1500 mg) following a  deliberate self-harm attempt. The patient was admitted and monitored. No adverse  effects were observed. A review of the literature showed very few reported  azathioprine overdoses. Lupus patients are at risk of developing low mood and  depression (and related self-harm including overdose of medication). This can be  as a consequence of the disease process itself or in reaction to the stresses of  living with a chronic disease, which are perhaps particularly acute in some  adolescents with the disease. An intentional overdose in a patient with lupus is  clearly a cry for help and should be appropriately managed. Counselling of young  people and their parents about possible mood disorders is an important part of  the management of this chronic disease. Despite the theoretical risk of  significant myelosuppression as well as other potential adverse effects,  azathioprine in acute overdose seems to be generally well tolerated.

SP  - 888-90
AB  - Lupoid perioral dermatitis is classified as a special form of perioral dermatitis  with dense aggregations of red-brown papules which display a lupoid infiltrate on  diascopy. There are various treatment options ranging from total avoidance of all  topical substances to different topical treatment. Cases resistant to therapy  require systemic treatment, which, however, is off-label use. In our case we were  able to achieve a significant improvement with systemic therapy with isotretinoin  over a period of 6 months.

T1  - Targeting the B-cell pathway in lupus nephritis: current evidence and future 
SP  - 745239
AB  - Nephritis represents a frequent, severe complication of systemic lupus  erythematosus. Autoantibodies appear to be fundamental in the pathogenesis of  lupus nephritis. Several hypotheses are currently experimentally tested to  further elucidate the direct induction of inflammation through interaction of the  pathological autoantibodies with intrinsic glomerular components and the  triggering of a complement-driven autoinflammatory cascade. B-cells have, in the  last decade, emerged as a promising new therapeutic target, as biological  treatments successfully attempting B-cell depletion, inhibition of B-cell  proliferation and differentiation, or modulation of B-cell function have become  bioengineered. Clinical trials have so far proved controversial regarding the  efficacy of these new agents. Thus, despite the short and long-term side effects  associated with immunosuppressive treatment alternative emerging treatments are  still regarded "rescue" regimens in refractory patients. In an effort to  accurately evaluate the potential of these therapies in lupus nephritis, several  issues have been raised mainly in terms of patient selection criteria and trial  duration. This review aims to expand on the proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms  implicating the B-cell pathway in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and  summarize current knowledge obtained from clinical trials introducing these  biologics in its treatment. Finally, it will elaborate on potential applications  of currently available biologic agents and forthcoming treatment options.

T1  - New drugs in systemic lupus erythematosus: when to start and when to stop.
SP  - S82-5
AB  - Survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has greatly improved  compared to earlier decades. However, this improvement appears to have reached a  plateau. In addition, damage accrual appears to have an important impact on  patient prognosis. In this scenario a number of new drugs targeting different  pathways of the immune response are being developed, and some are already  available in clinical practice. In clinical practice and in clinical trials, the  indications for treating SLE patients with new drugs are active or refractory  disease despite standard-of-care treatment. While RCTs are able to document the  capacity of new drugs to control the disease in selected patients, many important  questions arise from clinical practice and at present are largely unanswered.  When should we start a new drug? Should this drug be introduced early, as are  anti-TNF drugs in rheumatoid arthritis? Perhaps some drugs should be initiated  only after a patient's incomplete response? How many traditional drugs should be  used and for how long, before considering a new therapy? Should we stop an  effective drug and if yes, when and how? Additional studies and data derived from  registries and observational studies will give valuable evidence to answer these  questions. In this article, we review indications for the use of new drugs in  SLE, and examine existing data on patient outcome after withdrawal, focusing our  attention on rituximab and belimumab.

SP  - S71-4
AB  - Survival of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has greatly improved  over the decades. Many reasons for treatment withdrawal may be faced by the  physician during the disease course, such as inactivity of disease, damage  accrual, risks of long-term side effects, or potential interactions with other  drugs required to treat concomitant conditions, as well as patients' preferences.  Therefore, analysis of long-term therapy and treatment withdrawal is important.  We have examined the available literature concerning withdrawal of therapy, with  attention to glucocorticoids, antimalarial drugs and traditional  immunosuppressive drugs in SLE patients who did not have renal disease. We  expanded our search to address two questions: i) advantages of long-term therapy  in SLE (i.e. reduction of flares, reduction of damage accrual, improved  survival); and (ii) burden/side effects of therapy in SLE. Studies are needed to:  i) define remission in SLE; ii) define the advantages of long-term therapy in  non-renal lupus in terms of prevention of flares; iii) clarify the risks related  with long-term immunosuppressive therapy; iv) identify the appropriate patient at  the appropriate time for withdrawal of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive  therapy; and v) define withdrawal/tapering strategies.

SP  - 289316
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and pathologic features of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) that has atypical lupus nephritis (LN) with mainly IgA  deposits. METHODS: We searched the SLE patients who had nephritis with mainly IgA  deposits in our hospital and selected the information including clinical  manifestations, laboratory tests, treatments, and prognosis. RESULTS: From  January 2009 to June 2012, 5 patients were definitely diagnosed as SLE according  to both 1982 and 2009 ACR classification criteria. But renal biopsy showed that  all cases had mainly IgA deposits and were free of IgG, C1q, and  fibrinogen-related antigen deposits under immunofluorescent microscopy, which did  not match with typical LN. There were 2 males and 3 females, aging from 31 to 64  years and with an average of (42.20 +/- 13.59) years. The 5 cases had  multiple-system involvements, mainly the renal system. Compared to primary IgAN,  the atypical LN showed some differences: older than primary IgAN, more women than  men, no previous infection history, lower incidence of serum IgA elevation, and  ACL positive rate as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: Nephritis with mainly IgAN  deposits, as an atypical LN, may be a special subtype of SLE.

T1  - Laser therapy in the treatment of connective tissue diseases: a review.
SP  - 1-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Connective tissue diseases (CTD), including lupus erythematosus (LE),  scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and dermatomyositis, present with clinically unique  cutaneous manifestations often resistant to conventional therapy. The use of  lasers in the treatment of various dermatologic conditions continues to expand,  presenting an opportunity for incorporation of another mechanism of action in the  treatment of CTD. OBJECTIVES: To review the use of laser therapy in the treatment  of LE, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and dermatomyositis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A  MEDLINE search was conducted to find articles detailing treatment of CTD with  laser therapy. RESULTS: Thirty-nine published articles were identified. The  outcomes and results of case reports were reviewed for each CTD when possible.  CONCLUSIONS: Laser therapy offers novel and often effective treatment for  recalcitrant cutaneous conditions in LE, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and  dermatomyositis. Review of the literature revealed a limited number of reports,  many describing outdated technologies and techniques. It is therefore difficult  to draw substantial conclusions regarding safety and the known association with  photosensitivity. More-recent reports suggest that, with continued evolution of  technology and understanding of CTD, lasers will have an expanding role in the  treatment of cutaneous manifestations of CTD.

A discussion of antiphospholipid syndrome secondary to lupus,  specifically use of aspirin for asymptomatic patients, suggestions for  catastrophic antibody syndrome, and potential roles for rituximab and eculizumab  are provided. This review is a companion to an article published in this journal  last year and in combination provides recommendations for standard care in  routine cases of lupus as well as for the problematic, intractable patient.

SP  - 1251-8
AB  - Ischemic stroke is increased in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The  differential diagnosis of stroke in SLE is complex. Transient ischemic attack and  ischemic stroke share pathophysiologic mechanisms, but prognosis may vary  depending on severity and cause, and definitions are dependent on the timing and  extent of the diagnostic evaluation. In SLE patients with a history of transient  ischemic attacks, stroke occurred in 57%. Cerebrovascular events account for 20%  to 30% of deaths in patients with SLE. In SLE, both disease-specific and  traditional stroke risk factors are important.

SP  - 779-93
AB  - The value of classification systems applied to the examination of renal biopsies  is based on several factors: first, on the ability to provide efficient  communication between pathologists and between pathologists and clinicians;  second, on the possibility to implement diagnostic information with prognostic  indication. Even more important, the practical value of a classification is  proved by the ability of providing elements that guide therapeutic decisions and  can be used in the follow-up of the patient. With these aims, new histologic  classification systems have been proposed in the last decade for lupus nephritis  and IgA nephropathy under the leadership of the Renal Pathology Society and the  International Society of Nephrology. These classifications have gained a  significant level of worldwide acceptance and have been the subject of multiple  single-center and multicenter validation studies, which have underpinned their  clinical benefits and limitations and served to highlight remaining questions and  difficulties of interpretation of the biopsy sample. More recently, a  classification system has also been proposed for ANCA-associated crescentic  glomerulonephritis (ANCA-GN), although the validation process for this is still  in an early stage. In this review, we examine in some detail the ISN/RPS  classification for lupus nephritis and the Oxford classification for IgA  nephropathy, with emphasis on clinicopathologic correlations, their value for and  evolving impact on clinical studies and clinical practice, and their significant  limitations in this regard as exposed by validation studies. We also suggest  possible ways by which these classifications might be modified to make them more  applicable to clinical practice. Finally, we more briefly discuss the newly  proposed classification for ANCA-GN.

SP  - 1089-101
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disorder affecting multiple  organ systems. Glomerulonephritis leading to severe proteinuria, chronic renal  failure and end-stage renal disease remains one of the most severe complications  of systemic lupus erythematosus and is associated with significant morbidity and  mortality. Conventional lupus nephritis (LN) treatment based on cyclophosphamide,  steroids and, recently, mycophenolatemofetil has improved the outcome of the  disease over the last 50 years, although failure to achieve remission or  treatment resistance has been reported in 18-57% of patients. Chronic  complications such as long-term toxicity dampen their ability to maintain disease  remission. There is a need to develop more specific pharmacological agents for  patients to provide choices that are equally effective, less toxic and have fewer  complications. During the last 10 years, experimental studies based on different  pathogenesis pathways of LN have provided an enormous amount of knowledge and  have offered the possibility to target the disease with selective approaches. In  this article, we summarize the new experimental strategies that have recently  been utilized to target LN, focusing on mechanisms of action.

T1  - Improving outcomes in patients with lupus and end-stage renal disease.
SP  - 590-6
AB  - The development of lupus-related end-stage renal disease (ESRD) confers the  highest mortality rates among individuals with lupus. Lupus-related ESRD is also  associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates compared with non-lupus  ESRD. We review the evidence that persistent lupus activity, hypercoagulability,  and continuing immunosuppression may contribute to unfavorable outcomes in  dialysis and renal transplantation among lupus patients. Robust epidemiologic  studies are needed to develop individualized evidence-based approaches to  treating lupus-related ESRD. In the meantime, managing lupus-related ESRD  presents a significant challenge for clinicians and requires a team approach  involving nephrologists and rheumatologists. Goals of therapy after developing  ESRD should include continuing monitoring of lupus activity, minimizing  corticosteroid exposure, and choosing the most appropriate renal replacement  therapy based on patient's risk profile and quality-of-life considerations.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is uncommon in young children and unusual in  infancy. Although a variety of liver pathologies have been reported in SLE,  presentation of this disease with granulomatous liver involvement is very rare.  In this article, for the first time, we report an infant girl presenting with  unexplained hepatosplenomegaly and non-necrotizing granulomatous liver  involvement at the age of six months who later developed pancytopenia and  proteinuria and was finally diagnosed with SLE at the age of three years.  Therefore, we suggest that SLE could be considered as one of the possible  differential diagnoses when infants or children present with unexplained  granulomatous liver involvement.

SP  - 460-7
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune connective tissue disease  that is characterized by its chronic course and the involvement of many organs  and systems. The most common abnormality in the respiratory system of SLE  patients is lupus pleuritis. Less common is parenchymal involvement, which may  present as acute lupus pneumonitis (ALP) or chronic interstitial lung disease.  Other possible pulmonary manifestations of SLE include pulmonary embolism,  diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, acute reversible hypoxaemia, and shrinking lung  syndrome. We present the case report of a young woman with previously diagnosed  membranous glomerulonephritis with nephrotic syndrome and antiphospholipid  syndrome, who was admitted with marked of shortness of breath. The diagnostic  process, including imaging studies and laboratory tests, enabled us to confirm a  diagnosis of ALP. After initiation of treatment with high doses of  methyloprednisolone, nearly complete remission of pulmonary changes was observed.  We also perform a literature review regarding acute lupus pneumonitis.

SP  - 964-8
AB  - It is increasingly recognised that regular assessment of parent child-reported outcomes (PCROs) in routine paediatric rheumatology practice may  help to increase the quality of care of children with rheumatic diseases.  However, most of the instruments available for assessment of PCROs have remained  essentially research tools and are not routinely administered in most centres.  Recently, new multidimensional questionnaires for paediatric rheumatic diseases  have been devised. These tools have been specifically designed for regular  administration in a busy clinical setting and have the advantage over other  clinical measures of incorporating all main PCROs in a single instrument. This  review describes briefly the multidimensional questionnaires developed for the  assessment of PCROs in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, juvenile  dermatomyositis, and juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus and discusses the  rationale underlying their creation. Furthermore, it illustrates the methodology  and benefits related to the use of multidimensional questionnaires in the  collection of standardised quantitative data.

SP  - 761-72
AB  - B cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus  and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. There are various  strategies for targeting B cells including depletion, inhibition of survival  factors, activation and inhibition of co-stimulatory molecules. Controlled trials  in systemic lupus erythematosus have shown positive results for belimumab,  promising results for epratuzumab and negative results for rituximab. The failure  of rituximab in controlled trials has been attributed to trial design, sample  size and outcome measures rather than true inefficacy. In anti-neutrophil  cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, rituximab is effective for remission  induction and in relapsing disease. However, the optimal long-term re-treatment  strategy remains to be determined. Over the next 5 years, evidence will be  available regarding the clinical efficacy of these novel therapies, biomarkers  and their long-term safety.

T1  - Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 334-40
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an  underrecognized and reversible condition in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  that could mimic neuropsychiatric lupus. Identification of any distinct clinical  patterns is important as one would need to escalate rather than decrease or  discontinue immune suppression in neuropsychiatric lupus. METHODS: We  retrospectively identified and described 5 patients with SLE who were  hospitalized and diagnosed with PRES from 2008 to 2013 in a tertiary medical  center and reviewed relevant literature. RESULTS: Posterior reversible  encephalopathy syndrome in SLE occurred in young women with age distribution from  19 to 37 years. At the time of presentation, all had hypertension (systolic blood  pressures ranging from 150 to 220), moderate to severe disease activity (Systemic  Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores ranging from 11 to 41), and  prototypical magnetic resonance imaging findings of PRES and nephritis (4 of 5  patients had biopsy-proven lupus nephritis). Seizures, headache, and confusion  were the most common clinical symptoms. One patient had intracerebral hematoma,  and 2 patients had cerebral petechial hemorrhages. All patients improved without  any neurological deficits, with a mean hospital stay of 11.2 days. CONCLUSIONS:  Systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered in the differential diagnosis  of patients who present with PRES. One should have a low threshold for magnetic  resonance imaging especially when neurological symptoms occur in young women with  or without an established diagnosis of SLE and especially among those with active  SLE, lupus nephritis, renal failure, and/or poorly controlled hypertension. Given  the good prognosis of PRES in SLE patients with early supportive treatment,  prompt recognition is crucial to institute appropriate management.

SP  - 1819-22
AB  - Anti-TNF-alpha therapies are the latest class of medications found to be associated  with drug-induced lupus, a distinctive entity known as anti-TNF-alpha-induced lupus  (ATIL) (Williams et al., Rheumatology (Oxford) 48:716-20, 2009; De Rycke et al.,  Lupus 14:931-7, 2005; De Bandt et al., Clin Rheumatol 22:56-61, 2003). With the  widespread use of these agents, it is likely that the incidence of ATIL will  increase. The onset of ATIL in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's  disease has been described, but the literature regarding the occurrence of this  entity in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is scarce (De Bandt et al.,  Clin Rheumatol 22:56-61, 2003; Ramos-Casals et al., Autoimmun Rev 9:188-93, 2010;  Perez-Garcia et al., Rheumatology 45:114-116, 2006). To our knowledge, few  reports of switching anti-TNF-alpha therapy after ATIL in AS have been reported  (Akgul et al., Rheumatol Int, 2012). Therefore, it is not clear whether the  development of ATIL should prohibit switch to another therapy, since patients may  respond to another anti-TNF-alpha agent (Akgul et al., Rheumatol Int, 2012; Bodur et  al., Rheumatol Int 29:451-454, 2009; Mounach et al., Clin Exp Rheumatol  26:1116-8, 2008; Williams and Cohen, Int J Dermatol 50:619-625, 2011; Ye et al.,  J Rheumatol 38:1216, 2011; Wetter and Davis, Mayo Clin Proc 84:979-984, 2009;  Cush, Clin Exp Rheumatol 22:S141-147, 2004; Kocharla and Mongey, Lupus 18:169-7,  2009). A lack of published experience of successful anti-TNF-alpha switching is a  cause of concern for rheumatologists faced with this challenging clinical  scenario. We report the case of a 69-year-old woman with AS who developed  infliximab-induced lupus, which did not recur despite the subsequent institution  of etanercept. The authors review and discuss ATIL and the possible implications  for subsequent treatment with alternative anti-TNF-alpha agents.

T1  - Clinical features and prognostic factors of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
SP  - 419-27
AB  - This study aims to review clinical features, treatments, and prognostic factors  of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) associated with systemic lupus  erythematosus patients (sTTP). The case reports of sTTP published in world  literature from 1999 to 2011 were collected, and 105 cases were divided into  death group and survival group. The epidemiologic characteristics, clinical  manifestations, laboratory examinations, treatments, and prognostic factors were  analyzed. We found that coexistence of renal and neurological impairments were  significantly frequent in the death group (100%) than in the survival group  (56.5%) (P = 0.002). Type IV was predominant in 57.7% of renal pathological  damage, followed by type V (11.5%), type II (5.8%), and thrombotic  microangiopathy (TMA) (5.8%). TMA appeared more frequently (50%) in the death  group than in the survival group (6.25%) (P = 0.042). End-stage renal disease  occurred in nine cases with type IV in five (55.6%), type TMA in one (11.1%), and  unspecified in three cases (33.3%). Of 32 cases, 40.6% showed severe ADAMTS13  deficiency and returned to normal or mildly deficient after remission. The total  mortality rate of sTTP was 12.4 % and the mortality rate of patients with  infection (27.3%) was significantly higher than those without infection (8.4%) (P  = 0.028). Plasma exchange and glucocorticoids were administrated in over 80% of  cases with 65.7% remission rate, while additional cytotoxics or rituximab was  mostly used in refractory sTTP and achieved over 90 % of remission rate. Above  all, coexistence of renal and neurological impairments, infection, and renal  damage with type IV or TMA might denote a poor prognosis of sTTP.

T1  - Pathogenesis of pregnancy complications in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 591-6
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In spite of the advances made in the management of pregnancies  in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), maternal complications and  adverse fetal outcomes still exceed the rate of pregnancy complications in the  general population. An intriguing question relates to the observation that  pregnancy loss, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, and  preeclampsia remain major complications in SLE pregnancies, not substantially  altered by improved therapy and monitoring. RECENT FINDINGS: From the review of  the recent literature on the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss, IUGR, preeclampsia,  and prematurity, it appears that clinical or subclinical inflammation, presence  of autoantibodies, hormonal dysfunction, and immune alterations of lupus  contribute to pregnancy complications. Impairment of early placenta development  leads to poor vascularization, resulting in placental ischemia and subsequent  endothelial damage. Depending on the extent of the pathological process,  pregnancy loss, IUGR, and preeclampsia can develop. SUMMARY: Early recognition of  pregnancy complications is desirable in order to prevent their development or to  prompt intervention that improves the outcomes. Several biomarkers have been  investigated for their ability to predict complications at an early stage of  pregnancy. However, up to date only lupus anticoagulant has emerged as a  consistent predictor for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

SP  - 255-8
AB  - Scutula are characteristic lesions of tinea favosa or favus; the most frequently  identified causative organism is Trichophyton schoenleinii. Although scutula-like  lesions were described in Microsporum gypseum infection, their presence on  glabrous skin in a patient with SLE has not been reported previously. We report a  case of tinea infection with scutula-like lesions caused by Microsporum gypseum  in a SLE patient, who was treated with topical terbinafine cream, and the lesions  resolved completely. In addition, we reviewed the reported cases about this rare  clinical manifestation caused by Microsporum gypseum in the medical literature.

T1  - Top 10 developments in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 358
AB  - Lupus nephritis affects up to 60 % of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus  and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Traditionally, it has been  treated with high-dose immunosuppression consisting of cyclophosphamide and  prednisone; however, recent trials have demonstrated mycophenolate mofetil as a  safe and effective alternative for both induction and maintenance of disease.  Other progress has been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of lupus  nephritis, outcomes in renal transplantation, and associations with genetic risk  factors. This review highlights key developments in our understanding of lupus  nephritis over the past decade.

SP  - 213-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features, therapy and outcome of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) combined with lupus myelopathy (LM). METHODS: Ten SLE  patients combined with LM treated in Department of Rheumatology and Immunology,  People's Hospital from 1990 to 2011 were retrospectively analyzed and 43 cases of  SLE combined with LM reported home and abroad were reviewed. RESULTS: All the ten  patients were women with age of 23 - 53 (36.9 +/- 3.4) years old and duration of 1  - 18 years. MRI of spinal cord revealed long T2 signal in one case, and normal in  two cases. Seven patients received methylprednisolone pulse plus cyclophosphamide  (CTX), two were given glucocorticoid pulse only, and one was given moderate  dosage of glucocorticoid, CTX and plasma exchange (PE). The results revealed that  four patients received complete recovery, four received partial recovery, and two  received no improvement. CONCLUSIONS: LM is a rare but severe complication of SLE  with poor prognosis, which usually occurs in early phase of young SLE patients.  Pulse methylprednisolone and CTX may be effective. Early and active treatment may  improve the outcome.

SP  - 269-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the maternal and fetal outcomes in women with systemic lupus  erythematosus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 26 pregnancies in  15 systemic erythematosus patients diagnosed before or during pregnancy regarding  to American College of Rheumatology criteria in a single reference center.  RESULTS: The mean patient age was 31.52 years (24-39 years). The mean interval  from the diagnosis of the systemic lupus erythematosus to pregnancy was 4.2  years. Eight pregnancies were planned. The flare rate of lupus during pregnancy  was 31%, life birth rate was 65% and fetal loss rate was 35%. DISCUSSION AND  CONCLUSION: As an increase in disease activity can occur during pregnancy and  because of a higher rate of obstetrical complications in patients with lupus, it  is important to carefully plan pregnancy. Pregnancy in lupus patients must be  closely monitored by a multispeciality care of the patients.

T1  - Pathogenesis and treatment of CNS lupus.
SP  - 577-83
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Neuropsychiatric manifestations pose diagnostic and  therapeutic challenges in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We review recently  published studies on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, neuroimaging, and treatment  of NPSLE. RECENT FINDINGS: Generalized SLE activity or damage and  antiphospholipid antibodies are identified as major risk factors for  neuropsychiatric involvement. NPSLE patients have increased genetic burden and  novel genomic approaches are expected to elucidate its pathogenesis. Animal data  suggest that, in cases of disturbed blood-brain barrier, autoantibodies against  the NR2 subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and 16/6 idiotype  antibodies may cause diffuse neuropsychiatric manifestations through neuronal  apoptosis or brain inflammation; data in humans are still circumstantial. In  NPSLE, advanced neuroimaging uncovers structural and metabolic abnormalities in  brain regions with normal appearance on conventional MRI. Treatment includes  corticosteroids/immunosuppressants for inflammatory manifestations or generalized  SLE activity, and antiplatelets/anticoagulation for manifestations related to  antiphospholipid antibodies. In refractory cases, uncontrolled studies suggest a  beneficial role of rituximab. SUMMARY: We have begun to better understand how  brain-reactive autoantibodies, present in a proportion of SLE patients, can cause  brain injury and diffuse NPSLE. Further testing will be required to determine the  clinical utility of advanced neuroimaging. Controlled trials are needed to guide  therapeutic decisions.

SP  - 616-22
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This manuscript will provide a review of studies published in  the last year examining the major disease manifestations, comorbidities,  biomarkers and therapeutic trials involving childhood-onset systemic lupus  erythematosus (cSLE) patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent multicenter prospective  cohort studies supported previous findings that cSLE patients accrue damage early  on their disease. Four studies showed that ethnicity altered disease severity and  incidence of both cSLE and lupus nephritis. Description of clinical features and  response to therapy in a large group of cSLE patients with neuropsychiatric  involvement provided useful information on this feature. Advancement in the field  of biomarkers was seen but the new biomarkers are not yet ready for clinical use.  A randomized placebo-controlled trial of statins to prevent atherosclerosis  progression did not meet its primary endpoint but did show a trend in improvement  of carotid intima-media thickness, a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. No  other prospective interventional treatment trials designed specifically for cSLE  patients were reported in the past year. SUMMARY: There is an urgent need to  better characterize the long-term outcome of cSLE patients and identify early on  those at risk of a worse outcome. Advances in the field of biologics and small  molecules will hopefully allow better targeted therapies of the cSLE population.

T1  - [An innovative approach to the treatment of immune-mediated glomerular diseases].
AB  - Conventional treatment of most glomerular immune-mediated diseases is based  mainly on the use of cytotoxic immunosuppressants and corticosteroids. Although  this has resulted in improved survival, patients may suffer severe, sometimes  life-threatening, adverse events. The increasing need for safer and more  effective drugs along with burgeoning new insights into the pathogenesis of these  disorders has aroused interest in a variety of biological agents. In this  context, clinical trials involving the B-cell depletion agent Rituximab have been  especially promising. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody to the CD20 antigen on  B-cells that was initially designed and approved for the treatment of  non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma in 1997. Over the last 15 years, it has emerged as a  potent immunosuppressant for several immune-mediated diseases, initially for the  treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , with FDA approval in 2007. Subsequently its  use has been extended into several other fields, including the treatment of  glomerulonephritis. Recently (April 2011), the FDA approved Rituximab for the  treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. However, given its efficacy,  tolerability and safety profile in comparison to conventional treatment regimens,  it has been also studied in off-label use for many other glomerular diseases,  including membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and mixed cryoglobulinemia.

SP  - 438-454
AB  - During the last three decades, ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) phototherapy has emerged as  a specific phototherapeutic modality with distinct modes of action and some well  established indications. Atopic dermatitis, localized scleroderma, and systemic  lupus erythematosus seem to be the conditions with the best evidence regarding  efficacy and safety of UVA1 phototherapy. Further indications for UVA1 include  subacute prurigo, lichen sclerosus, dyshidrotic dermatitis, cutaneous T cell  lymphoma, urticaria pigmentosa, and pityriasis rosea; nevertheless, there are  some unknowns, uncertainties, and controversies concerning short- and long-term  side effects, efficacy and dosage regimens of UVA1 phototherapy in some  conditions. We describe and discuss treatment regimens, protocols, dosage, and  indications for UVA1 phototherapy.

T1  - Liver transplantation with a strongly positive crossmatch: case study and 
SP  - 1001-10
AB  - A positive crossmatch has been associated with increased risk in liver  transplantation. To study the clinical significance of preformed donor-specific  human leukocyte antigen antibodies (DSAs) in liver transplantation, we reviewed  patients who underwent liver transplantation with a strongly positive flow  cytometry crossmatch. DSAs were evaluated with a Luminex solid phase assay. The  complement-fixing ability of DSAs was tested with a complement component 1q (C1q)  assay. Using an assay correlation between complement-dependent cytotoxicity  crossmatch, flow cytometry crossmatch, and DSA results, we reviewed the effects  of DSAs on the outcomes of our patients as well as reported cases in the  literature. Five of 69 liver recipients had a strongly positive crossmatch: 4 had  a positive T cell crossmatch [median channel shift (MCS) = 383.5 +/- 38.9], and 5  had a positive B cell crossmatch (MCS = 408.8 +/- 52.3). The DSAs were class I only  in 1 patient, class I and II in 3 patients, and class II only in 1 patient.  Cholestasis, acute rejection, or both were observed in 3 of the 4 patients with a  positive T cell crossmatch with an MCS approximately greater than 300. The C1q  assay was positive for 3 patients. Two had either persistent cholestasis or early  acute rejection. One patient who was treated with preemptive intravenous  immunoglobulin had an unremarkable outcome despite a positive C1q result. One of  the 2 patients with a negative C1q assay experienced persistent cholestasis and  early and recurrent acute rejection; the other had an unremarkable outcome. None  of the patients died or lost a graft within the first year of transplantation.  Our study suggests that human leukocyte antigen antibody screening, flow  cytometry crossmatch MCS levels, DSA mean fluorescent intensity levels, and C1q  assays may be useful in assessing the risk of antibody-mediated rejection and  timely interventions in liver transplantation.

SP  - 352-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic literature review to determine factors that  influence damage and damage progression in SLE patients and how damage relates to  mortality in this population. METHODS: A search of Medline, Embase and Web of  Science was performed, with papers included if they met the requirements of  containing keywords relating to SLE and damage assessment using the SDI,  published between 1990 and October 2012. RESULTS: A total of 358 articles were  identified, with 50 included in this review. From 17 studies reporting damage at  more than 2 time points, damage progressed over time, but the rate of damage  accrual reported was variable across studies. Demographic factors that influence  the accrual of damage in several reports include male gender, older age, longer  disease duration, Afro-Caribbean and Indo-Asian ethnicity. Patients with higher  disease activity at a single time point or over time accrue greater damage.  Certain organ system involvement also predicts damage accrual, in particular  renal and neuropsychiatric involvement. Corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and  azathioprine all show an association with damage accrual, while  hydroxychloroquine appears to have a "protective" effect. Four studies, which  examined prognosis, all demonstrated that damage is a predictor of future  mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Damage in SLE patients increases over time and predicts  future mortality. Patients at risk of damage can be identified from demographics  factors and the pattern of clinical involvement. Disease activity,  corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are also associated with future  damage but further studies are needed to separate the mechanisms of these  associations from the problem of residual confounding.

T1  - MicroRNAs in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 115-21
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease,  characterized by the production of autoantibodies against multiple organs.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, single-stranded small RNAs that  post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Evidence is accumulating that  miRNAs play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SLE. This article reviews the  pertinent publications (searched from the PubMed database) involving the  mechanisms of actions of miRNA associated with the pathogenesis of SLE. The  search of related literature was extended as far back as 1979. In this  mini-review we first introduce the miRNAs briefly and later discuss their  regulatory roles in the DNA methylation pathway, type I interferon pathway,  estrogen and regulatory T-cells in the pathogenesis of SLE.

SP  - 104-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We report the case of a 28-year-old patient with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) with rapid onset of dyspnea and hemoptysis found to have  diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) with refractory hypoxemia successfully treated  with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The discussion  includes clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, outcome, and a review of  the available adult literature on the use of ECMO in patients with DAH. DESIGN:  Case report. SETTING: Froedtert Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin.  DATA SOURCES: Data were collected from the patient's electronic medical record  and the hospital radiology database. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage  secondary to SLE is quite rare. The adult literature on the utilization of ECMO  for DAH is limited mostly to antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody  (ANCA)-associated alveolar hemorrhage and a few reports of nonvasculitis DAH.  Bleeding has been a contraindication to ECMO due to the need for systemic  anticoagulation. Our case, along with a review of the literature, indicates that  ECMO with anticoagulation can be safely utilized in patients with DAH. To our  knowledge, this is the first reported adult case of DAH due to SLE successfully  treated with ECMO.

SP  - 133-40
AB  - When the central nervous system is the primary affected site in an initial attack  of Behcet's disease (BD), the differential diagnosis is particularly challenging.  Because the specificity of immunobiologic therapy is growing, the specific  diagnosis may impact the chosen therapy. For instance, anti-tumour necrosis  factor agents are efficacious in BD but may be harmful in multiple sclerosis or  systemic lupus erythematosus. We present two cases with similar neurological  features but different diagnosis (BD and systemic lupus erythematosus) as a  starting point to review diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for neuro-BD and  its differential diagnoses.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus-related pancreatitis in children.
SP  - 913-8
AB  - We report on three patients who developed four episodes of acute pancreatitis  while their systemic lupus erythematosus was active and being treated with  prednisolone. In all three, gastritis was first considered and treated due to  abdominal pain, vomiting, and epigastric tenderness, but their symptoms did not  improve. Then pancreatic enzymes were measured, which confirmed pancreatitis.  Imaging studies showed an enlarged pancreas in one case, a normal pancreas in two  cases, and a focal hypodense nonenhancing parenchyma in one case. Corticosteroids  were prescribed for both active SLE and SLE-related pancreatitis. Pulse  methylprednisolone was prescribed in one episode, increasing oral prednisolone in  one episode, and the same dose of prednisolone continued in the other two  episodes. All cases recovered without complications. SLE-related pancreatitis  should be considered in SLE patients when the SLE is active and a patient  develops abdominal pain and vomiting.

T1  - [Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus: myths, certainties and doubts].
SP  - 533-42
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease with different clinical  forms of presentation, including a wide range of severity and organic  involvement. Such circumstance, along with the fact of the uncommon nature of the  disease and the absence of clinically representative response criteria, make it  difficult to design controlled clinical trials in SLE patients. As a result,  observational studies have a special relevance, being a source of valuable  information of SLE prognosis and outcome as well as of the efficacy and adverse  effects of the different therapies. Herein we update some of the main treatments  used in SLE. Steroids may have more risks than benefits if used at high doses.  New mechanisms of action have been described, supporting the use of lower doses,  possibly with the same efficacy and less adverse effects. Intravenous pulses of  cyclophosphamide still have a role in the treatment of proliferative lupus  nephritis and other serious SLE manifestations. Mycophenolate mofetil has shown  its efficacy both as induction and maintenance therapy of selected cases of lupus  nephritis. Biological therapies have emerged as new promising options. Although  clinical trials have not confirmed a clear superiority of rituximab in SLE,  observational studies have shown good response rates in severe SLE manifestations  or refractory forms. Belimumab has recently been added to the therapeutic  armamentarium of SLE; although its place in clinical practice is not  well-defined, it may be recommended in active patients with no response or good  tolerance to standard therapies. Hydroxichloroquine improves survival, decreases  the risk of thrombosis and flares and is safe in pregnancy, and should be  considered the baseline therapy in most SLE patients.

T1  - Anti B-cell therapy against refractory thrombocytopenia in SLE and MCTD patients: 
SP  - 664-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the  clinical and immunological effects of anti-B cell treatment in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective-tissue disease (MCTD)  with autoimmune thrombocytopenia (AITP) refractory to conventional  immunosuppressive treatment. METHODS: Rituximab (RTX) was added to the ongoing  treatment of 16 patients (median age 36 years, range 17-84, all female) with  treatment-resistant AITP. Thirteen patients had SLE and three had MCTD. RTX was  given intravenously on four occasions during four consecutive weeks at a dose of  375 mg/m(2). Clinical and laboratory disease activity variables recorded at every  follow-up visit were analyzed. RESULTS: The median disease duration before RTX  treatment was nine years (range 0.2-27) and the median post-treatment follow-up  time was 28 months (range 3 to 92). Ten patients (63%) were treated repeatedly  with RTX during the follow-up period. Complete depletion of B cells was achieved  in 94% of cases one month after RTX treatment. A significant increase (p =  0.0001) of platelet counts was seen already after one month (median 58 x 10(9)/ml  vs 110 x 10(9)/ml) whereas within three months platelet counts normalized in 10  patients (median 223 x 10(9)/ml). Three patients did not respond to RTX treatment  (median platelet count 69 x 10(9)/ml). High titers of anti-platelet antibodies  were detected in seven patients before RTX treatment, and the autoantibody titers  decreased significantly (p < 0.03) after RTX treatment in six of these patients  who also achieved complete remission. A review of the literature revealed 24  articles including 18 case reports, one retrospective cohort study and five  prospective studies documenting the outcomes of 65 RTX-treated patients with SLE-  or MCTD-related thrombocytopenia with an overall treatment response rate of 80%.  In conclusion, these findings indicate that RTX is an additional potent  therapeutic treatment option for SLE patients with AITP refractory to  conventional immunosuppressive treatment whereas best response may be expected in  patients with high titers of anti-platelet antibodies at baseline.

SP  - 1775-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and safety of nonbiologic immunosuppressants  in the treatment of nonrenal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We  conducted a sensitive literature search in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane  Central Register of Controlled Trials up to October 2011. The selection criteria  were studies including adult patients with SLE, a treatment intervention with  nonbiologic immunosuppressants, a placebo or active comparator group, and outcome  measures assessing efficacy and/or safety. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews,  clinical trials, and cohort studies were included. The quality of each study was  evaluated using Jadad's scale and the Oxford Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: In  total, 158 of the 2,827 initially found articles were selected for detailed  review; 65 studies fulfilled the predetermined criteria. Overall, the studies  were low quality, with only 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  Cyclophosphamide demonstrated efficacy for neuropsychiatric SLE, preventing  relapses with an additional steroid sparing effect, although its use was  associated with cumulative damage, development of cervical intraepithelial  neoplasia,and ovarian failure. Other immunosuppressants (azathioprine,  methotrexate, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil,and cyclosporin A) demonstrated  efficacy in reducing nonrenal activity and flares with a steroid-sparing effect,  although only on occasion in non-placebo-controlled RCTs of small numbers of  patients. CONCLUSION: Several immunosuppressants demonstrated their safety and  efficacy in nonrenal SLE. A specific drug for each particular manifestation  cannot be recommended, although cyclophosphamide may be used in more severe  cases, and methotrexate may be the first option in most cases of moderately  active SLE. High-quality RCTs of larger numbers of patients are needed.

T1  - Top 10 things to know about lupus activity measures.
SP  - 334
AB  - Accurately measuring lupus disease activity has been a demanding and still  unresolved task, considering the complex multisystem nature of the disease and  its variability over time and between patients. Various available tools for  measurement of lupus disease activity may detect clinical improvement and/or  deterioration and can be global or organ-focused. Several measures have  demonstrated validity, reliability, and sensitivity to change in observational  studies, and some were found useful in randomized controlled trials. Evaluation  of their content and metric properties and critical review of their strengths and  weaknesses facilitates selection of the appropriate tool according to the outcome  of interest, and forms the basis for their optimization. In this review, we  highlight recent progress in lupus disease activity measures and point to future  directions in this field, with a focus on novel composite measurements derived by  combining outcome measures in ways that might compensate for their individual  deficiencies.

T1  - B-cell depletion in SLE: clinical and trial experience with rituximab and 
SP  - S2
AB  - B cells are believed to be central to the disease process in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), making them a target for new therapeutic intervention. In  recent years there have been many publications regarding the experience in SLE of  B-cell depletion utilising rituximab, an anti-CD20 mAb that temporarily depletes  B cells,reporting promising results in uncontrolled open studies and in routine  clinical use. However, the two large randomised controlled trials in extra-renal  lupus (EXPLORER study) and lupus nephritis (LUNAR study) failed to achieve their  primary endpoints. Based on the clinical experience with rituximab this failure  was somewhat unexpected and raised a number of questions and concerns, not only  into the true level of benefit of B-cell depletion in a broad population but also  how to test the true level of effectiveness of an investigational agent as we  seek to improve the design of therapeutic trials in SLE. A better understanding  of what went wrong in these trials is essential to elucidate the underlying  reasons for the disparate observations noted in open studies and controlled  trials. In this review, we focus on various factors that may affect the ability  to accurately and confidently establish the level of treatment effect of the  investigational agent, in this case rituximab, in the tw studies and explore  hurdles faced in the randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of  ocrelizumab, the humanised anti-CD20 mAb, in SLE. Further, based on the lessons  learned from the clinical trials, we make suggestions that could be implemented  in future clinical trial design to overcome the hurdles faced.

T1  - Rituximab treatment in lupus nephritis--where do we stand?
SP  - 381-9
AB  - Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a severe disease  manifestation in which novel therapeutic strategies are needed, especially in  non-responding patients or patients who relapse after conventional treatment.  Rituximab has been used as off-label treatment for lupus nephritis (LN) during  the last decade, and to date reports on the clinical effects on more than 400  patients, including the randomized controlled LUNAR study population, have been  published. Despite promising results obtained from observational studies and  registries, with complete or partial renal response after 6-12 months in 67-77%  of patients, the LUNAR trial failed to attain the primary endpoint and rituximab  is today unlikely to be approved as treatment for LN. Rituximab has mainly been  used as induction therapy in combination with standard of care but the optimal  treatment protocol is still to be determined. From observational studies,  rituximab has been shown to be efficient in both proliferative and membranous LN,  and histopathological studies have demonstrated improvement in renal activity.  Adverse events mainly include infusion reactions and infections. Although not  approved for the treatment of LN, the currently available data support that  rituximab may be used in severe, refractory cases of LN.

T1  - Seronegative antiphospholipid syndrome.
SP  - 1358-67
AB  - APS is an autoimmune disease that leads to arterial and/or venous thrombosis,  recurrent pregnancy loss and persistently positive aPLs. Patients with clinical  manifestations highly suggestive of APS but persistently negative conventional  aPLs are classified as having seronegative APS. Ongoing research has revealed the  existence of non-criteria antibodies proposed to be relevant to APS and that can  be potentially included in the disease's classification criteria. We present a  literature review on the most promising antibodies of this heterogeneous aPL  family, which includes antibodies to a zwitterionic phospholipid, namely  phosphatidylethanolamine, phospholipid-binding plasma proteins,  phospholipid-protein complexes and anionic phospholipids other than cardiolipin.  Although these molecules can increase the diagnostic yield of APS, their clinical  relevance is still debatable and needs to be confirmed by interlaboratory efforts  toward standardizing diagnostic tools, in addition to experimental data and  larger longitudinal studies.

T1  - The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus 
SP  - 243-55
AB  - The pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) entails a complex  interaction between the different arms of the immune system. While autoantibodies  production and immune complex deposition are cornered as hallmark features of  SLE, there is growing evidence to propose the pathogenic role of cytokines in  this disease. Examples of these cytokines include BLys, interleukin-6,  interleukin-17, interleukin-18, type I interferons and tumour necrosis factor  alpha. These cytokines all assume pivotal functions to orchestrate the  differentiation, maturation and activation of various cell types, which would  mediate local inflammatory process and tissue injury. The knowledge on these  cytokines not only fosters our understanding of the disease, but also provides  insights in devising biomarkers and targeted therapies. In this review, we focus  on cytokines which have substantial pathogenic significance and also highlight  the possible clinical applications of these cytokines.

T1  - Belimumab: targeted therapy for lupus.
SP  - 4-13
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex autoimmune disease with multisystem  involvement, is characterised by recurring flares and remissions throughout the  course of illness. The agents currently being used for management include  corticosteroids, antimalarials and various immunosuppressants. Belimumab, a B  lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) inhibitor has been recently approved for the  treatment of SLE. This review aims to discuss the role of belimumab in the  treatment of SLE and the trials leading to its FDA approval. Belimumab  demonstrated high degree of activity in patients with autoantibody-positive  active SLE disease on a stable treatment regimen. There was a significantly  greater response compared to placebo as assessed with the SLE Responder Index  (SRI) in two randomized, double-blind, phase III trials (BLISS-52 and BLISS-76).  The treatment was well tolerated. Additional studies are required to evaluate  belimumab in special populations and assess its long-term safety. This therapy  could change the focus of management from symptomatic treatment to targeting an  important step in the disease pathogenesis. It could enable development of  treatment which could halt long-term progression, minimize target organ damage  and thus provide a better quality of life for these patients.

T1  - Update on the treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 224-30
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lupus nephritis occurs in as many as half of patients  presenting with systemic lupus erythematosus and is a major predictor of  morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Prior to the last decade, the  treatment of lupus nephritis was largely limited to corticosteroids, high-dose  alkylating agents, and azathioprine, and this therapy was broadly prescribed  regardless of patient demographics, clinical presentation, or prior toxicities.  RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last decade, new immunomodulatory agents have emerged  as effective induction and maintenance therapies in lupus nephritis. With these  options, physicians are able to individualize the treatment regimens in an  attempt to maximize clinical benefit and minimize adverse events. Moreover, the  influence of patient demographics on disease severity and response to treatment  has come to the forefront. SUMMARY: Here, we review the recent progress made in  the therapy of lupus nephritis with a focus on the randomized controlled trials  which have demonstrated the efficacy of these new treatment regimens.

T1  - Valproate-induced hyperammonaemia superimposed upon severe neuropsychiatric 
SP  - 403-7
AB  - This paper presents a case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with  neuropsychiatric features, where the outcome was influenced by the development of  hyperammonaemia, probably induced by sodium valproate. A case of severe SLE  occurring in a 20-year-old Maori girl is described. Her disease had been  characterised by neuropsychiatric features for several years, culminating in  persistent seizure activity at the time of her final presentation. Her management  with anticonvulsants was complicated by the development of intractable  hyperammonaemia which contributed to irreversible clinical deterioration. We have  reviewed the English literature for reports of valproate-related hyperammonaemia  which has often been described in the setting of seizure and mood disorders. This  is the first case where it has been reported, superimposed upon severe  neuropsychiatric SLE (NP-SLE). The mechanism by which valproate induces  hyperammonaemia remains incompletely understood but is likely to relate to the  urea cycle. Under normal metabolic conditions, acyl-CoA is transported into the  mitochondria via a carnitine transport system. It is then converted to acetyl-CoA  via beta-oxidation and eventually to N-acetyl glutamate. This pathway can be  interrupted by the introduction of sodium valproate, leading to a reduction of  free coenzyme A, acetyl-CoA and carnitine, and resulting in the decreased  availability of cofactors necessary for the function of the urea cycle. As this  is the primary means of ammonia metabolism, serious elevation in serum ammonia  levels may occur in patients on this anticonvulsant medication. In this patient  with active NP-SLE, the combined autoimmune and metabolic brain insult  contributed to a fatal outcome.

AB  - The recent approval of belimumab for the treatment of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) ended a decade in which there was mounting optimism about the  prospect for developing biologically based therapies for SLE. During this same  period, steady progress had been made in understanding and applying conventional  therapies for SLE. These advances in the use of conventional therapies provide an  important frame of reference for evaluating the novel biologic therapies that are  expected to emerge in the near future.

T1  - Could we abandon cyclophosphamide in systemic vasculitis and lupus nephritis?
SP  - ii62-5
AB  - Cyclophosphamide has greatly improved prognosis in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic  autoantibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and proliferative lupus nephritis (LN).  However, the side effects of long-term cyclophosphamide treatment are  considerable prompting a search for alternatives to cyclophosphamide. For  maintenance treatment in AAV, azathioprine is the preferred drug with  methotrexate as an alternative in the case of intolerance to azathioprine. Data  on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for the induction of remission in AAV are being  awaited, but rituximab appears as effective as cyclophosphamide in newly  diagnosed patients with AAV, and is probably even better for relapsing patients,  while the possibility of maintenance treatment with intermittent low-dose  infusions of rituximab is being explored. In LN, low-dose intravenous  cyclophosphamide is as effective as high-dose cyclophosphamide for the induction  of remission, with azathioprine being used for maintenance treatment. MMF can be  used in the case of intolerance to cyclophosphamide and might be the first choice  in black and Hispanic patients. In the case of intolerance to both  cyclophosphamide and MMF, azathioprine with pulses of methylprednisolone can be  used. Here, the role of rituximab has not been established. In conclusion,  alternatives are available for cyclophosphamide both in AAV and proliferative LN.

T1  - [Class IV-G and IV-S lupus nephritis, interstitial infiltrates and prognosis: 
SP  - 655-60
AB  - Nephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus is one of the manifestations of organ  damage in this autoimmune disease. Class IV is the most ominous among the classes  of nephritides and there are conflicting reports on whether class IV-G lupus  nephritis differs from class IV-S as defined by the International Society of  Nephrology and the Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) in terms of kidney and  patient survival. There is, however, general agreement that 15-30% of patients  with class IV nephritis do not reach remission and that a similar percentage  (15-30%) of those reaching remission relapses. The presence of interstitial  nephritis may be one of the determinants of a poor disease course. In fact, in  recent years new data have emerged regarding the role of interstitial infiltrates  in determining a poor outcome, but until now no data have been gathered on the  differentiation of outcomes among class IV-G or IV-S with and without  infiltrates.

T1  - Diagnosis and treatment of lupus nephritis flares--an update.
SP  - 709-17
AB  - Relapses or flares of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are frequent and  observed in 27-66% of patients. SLE flares are defined as an increase in disease  activity, in general, requiring alternative treatment or intensification of  therapy. A renal flare is indicated by an increase in proteinuria and/or serum  creatinine concentration, abnormal urine sediment or a reduction in creatinine  clearance rate as a result of active disease. The morbidity associated with renal  flares is derived from both the kidney damage due to lupus nephritis and  treatment-related toxic effects. Current induction treatment protocols achieve  remission in the majority of patients with lupus nephritis; however, few studies  focus on treatment interventions for renal flares in these patients. The  available data, however, suggest that remission can be induced again in a  substantial percentage of patients experiencing a lupus nephritis flare. Lupus  nephritis flares are independently associated with an increased risk of  deterioration in renal function; prevention of renal flares might, therefore,  also decrease long-term morbidity and mortality. Appropriate immunosuppressive  maintenance therapy might lead to a decrease in the occurrence of renal and  extrarenal flares in patients with SLE, and monitoring for the early detection  and treatment of renal flares could improve their outcomes.

T1  - Mycophenolate mofetil versus azathioprine as maintenance therapy for lupus 
SP  - 104-10
AB  - AIM: The options for long-term maintenance therapy in lupus nephritis (LN) remain  controversial. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed  the prognosis and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) versus azathioprine (AZA)  used as maintenance therapy for lupus nephritis. METHODS: The data of Cochrane  Library, PubMed, EMBASE were retrieved to search the studies about the RCT  studies that compared MMF with AZA used as maintenance therapy for lupus  nephritis. We extracted the data reflecting prognosis, which included mortality,  end-stage renal failure (ESRF), renal relapse, doubling serum creatinine, and  adverse effects, then further analyzed the combined results of data and  calculated the relative risk (RR). RESULTS: Four RCT studies including 328  patients were enrolled into our meta-analysis. There was no difference between  the patients receiving either MMF or AZA for maintenance therapy in preventing  relapse, progression to end-stage renal failure, death and doubling of serum  creatinine. MMF is not superior to AZA in terms of the risks of infection and  gastrointestinal upset, but fewer patients receiving MMF developed leukopenia (RR  0.12; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04-0.39; P = 0.0004) and amenorrhoea (RR  0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.72; P = 0.02) than those receiving AZA. CONCLUSION: The  current limited evidence suggests that MMF offers similar prognosis as AZA for  maintenance therapy, while MMF appears safer than AZA in the treatment of lupus  nephritis.

SP  - 295-301
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at risk of premature  atherosclerosis. Conventional prediction risk equations do not adequately predict  the cardiovascular risk of these patients because of the complex interaction of  traditional and SLE specific risk factors and treatment effects, as well as, the  dynamic insult to the vasculature. Non-invasive vascular assessment is able to  evaluate the vascular damage accumulated over time. The aim of this review is to  examine the role of non-invasive assessment of endothelial function and arterial  stiffness as surrogate markers for vascular risk in SLE patients.

T1  - Type B insulin resistance syndrome induced by systemic lupus erythematosus and 
SP  - 181-8
AB  - Type B insulin resistance syndrome is characterized by the formation of  autoantibodies against insulin receptors, which can cause severe hyperglycemia  and insulin resistance. Systemic lupus erythematosus is the most common  underlying diseases of the syndrome. This report details our study of a case  involving a Chinese female with type B insulin resistance syndrome as well as  systemic lupus erythematosus who completely recovered after undergoing  immunosuppressive therapy, specifically pulse therapy utilizing intravenous  immunoglobulin. We also conducted search in MEDLINE and Chinese BioMedicine  database to identify relevant literatures published in the past 46 years. From  our searches, six case reports in Chinese, 15 case reports, and a 28-year  perspective article in English met our criteria; a total of 67 cases were  included in our report. The mean age of subjects at presentation for groups A, B,  and C were 42.95, 44.10, and 41.68 years, respectively, yielding no significant  difference between these groups. African Americans were the most susceptible  group to type B insulin resistance syndrome, followed by Asians representing  20.90 % of all cases. Comparisons between the three main racial groups surveyed  indicated that the mean age of subjects at presentation were very contiguous for  African Americans and Asians, and mean age of white people was remarkably higher  than either of the first two groups. The syndrome appeared most common among  Asian males, and white males were relatively less likely to suffer from type B  insulin resistance syndrome. Hypoglycemia was most commonly observed in white  people than in other racial groups. Hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum  immunoglobulin G, and elevated sedimentation rates were more common in African  Americans; Asian cases were more likely to show low serum C3 or C4 and nephritis.  Two cases received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, which has a remarkably  rapid effect on insulin resistance.

SP  - 1211-7
AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increasingly recognized complication of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To develop a more comprehensive understanding  of the clinical and pathological characteristics of pulmonary hypertension  associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (PH/SLE) in the Chinese population,  a systematic review of the literature up to 2012 was conducted. Six hundred and  forty-two Chinese PH/SLE cases from 22 studies were identified as well documented  and further analyzed. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), X-ray,  electrocardiogram and right heart catheterization (RHC) were performed to  diagnose PH in SLE patients. The mean age of subjects was 35.5 years, the male to  female ratio was 1:14, and the mean duration of SLE when PH was diagnosed was  10.7 years. The prevalence of PH in SLE was 2.8-23.3 %. Symptoms were usually  nonspecific, and the observed clinical characteristics include Raynaud's  phenomenon (41.4 %), serous effusion (27.7 %), positive RNP (51.5 %) and positive  ACL (46.6 %). Gold standard RHC is strongly recommended, especially for those who  had resting pulmonary arterial systolic pressure >30 mmHg on TTE with the  aforementioned clinical characteristics. Corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and  vasodilators were the most common medications employed in treatment. Early  identification and standard PH treatment with intensive SLE treatment can improve  the prognosis.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: a critical review.
SP  - 174-94
AB  - Lupus nephritis remains one of the most severe manifestations of systemic lupus  erythematosus associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. A better  understanding of the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis is an important step in  identifying more targeted and less toxic therapeutic approaches. Substantial  research has helped define the pathogenetic mechanisms of renal manifestations  and, in particular, the complex role of type I interferons is increasingly  recognized; new insights have been gained into the contribution of immune  complexes containing endogenous RNA and DNA in triggering the production of type  I interferons by dendritic cells via activation of endosomal toll-like receptors.  At the same time, there have been considerable advances in the treatment of lupus  nephritis. Corticosteroids have long been the cornerstone of therapy, and the  addition of cyclophosphamide has contributed to renal function preservation in  patients with severe proliferative glomerulonephritis, though at the cost of  serious adverse events. More recently, in an effort to minimize drug toxicity and  achieve equal effectiveness, other immunosuppressive agents, including  mycophenolate mofetil, have been introduced. Herein, we provide a detailed review  of the trials that established the equivalency of these agents in the induction  and/or maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis, culminating in the recent  publication of new treatment guidelines by the American College of Rheumatology.  Although newer biologics have been approved and continue to be a focus of  research, they have, for the most part, been relatively disappointing compared to  the effectiveness of biologics in other autoimmune diseases. Early diagnosis and  treatment are essential for renal preservation.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: is the kidney biopsy currently necessary in the management of 
SP  - 138-45
AB  - Most patients with SLE develop kidney disease related to this systemic underlying  disease process. Lupus nephritis is an important cause of morbidity and even  mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus nephritis has  diverse morphologic manifestations with varying clinical presentations and  consequences. The pathogeneses involve immune complexes, which can deposit  anywhere in the kidney, and other mechanisms, including endothelial injury,  podocytopathy, and tubulointerstitial injury. Treatment and prognosis accordingly  range from excellent even with only observation with minimal mesangial deposits,  to kidney failure despite aggressive immunosuppression in patients with severe  proliferative disease. Renal biopsy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of the  specific form of lupus nephritis in any patient. However, the role of the renal  biopsy in prediction of outcome, treatment, and prognosis has been controversial.  We will review the current classification of lupus nephritis and the value of  renal biopsy in the management of these patients.

T1  - Retinal vasculitis in rheumatic diseases: an unseen burden.
SP  - 7-13
AB  - Retinal vascular inflammation, a potentially blinding condition (herein: retinal  vasculitis (RV)) is commonly associated with a heterogeneous group of diseases  characterized by systemic inflammatory cell infiltration and/or necrosis of blood  vessel walls. RV may arise as an isolated ocular disorder, as part of systemic  vasculitis (Wegener's granulomatosis and Adamantiadis-Behcet Disease), or it can  be secondary to an underlying connective tissue disease (systemic lupus  erythematosus, sarcoidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis), systemic infection, or  malignancy. Depending on the type of RV, it can be a potentially disabling  condition, in the short or long term. Early diagnosis is the key to successful  treatment and better prognosis. However, early diagnosis can be difficult,  because these conditions usually present with nonspecific visual symptoms for a  long period before diagnostic manifestations occur. The retina should be examined  in warranted patients with verified rheumatic disease, since retinal vasculitis  may be asymptomatic at the beginning (peripheral retinal disease). RV can be  detected clinically (often accompanied by uveitis, scleritis, or macular edema)  or revealed on fluorescein fundus angiography, even if minimal signs of retinal  vessel inflammation are present. RV may also represent one of the possible  extra-articular manifestations of the rheumatic disease. Rheumatologists should  be familiar with the ocular manifestations of these disorders, since they may not  only be sight-threatening, but more importantly, could be the presenting or even  the very first manifestations of active, potentially lethal systemic disease in a  patient with nonspecific rheumatologic presentation.

SP  - 731-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety of rituximab therapy for systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trails  and observational studies that evaluated the effect of rituximab based on the  systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI), British Isles lupus  assessment group index (BILAG), urine protein levels, and the prednisolone dose,  and had adequate data to calculate the mean, standard deviation (SD), and 95%  confidence intervals, and to systematically review and meta-analyze observational  studies with fixed effects model or random effects model. RESULTS: We included 2  randomized controlled studies and 19 observational clinical studies. We  summarized the data from the 19 observational studies, analyzed the heterogeneity  of the literature, and then used fixed effect model or random effect model for  statistical analysis. The SLEDAI, BILAG, and urine protein levels and the  prednisolone dosage were decreased after rituximab treatment, and the decreases  in the BILAG, urine protein levels, and the prednisolone dose were found to be  significant (P<0.05), when compared with baseline level. Rituximab's adverse  effects generally could be controlled with an effective dosing regimen.  CONCLUSIONS: Although there are still controversies about rituximab's treatment  on SLE, but our study had showed that rituximab had favorable effects on  refractory lupus. The long-term efficacy and safety of rituximab require further  study.

T1  - Management of pregnancy in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 710-8
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoantibody-mediated systemic  autoimmune disease, predominantly affecting young females. Pregnancy is  increasingly common in the setting of SLE, as survival and quality of life of  patients improve. Although live births can be achieved in the most cases,  pregnancy in patients with SLE remains a high-risk condition. Maternal and fetal  mortality and morbidity are considerably increased, compared with the general  population. Aberrations in pregnancy-related maternal immune adaptations are  likely contributors. Active maternal disease, renal involvement, specific  autoantibody subsets and advanced organ damage are predictors of poor outcome.  Therapeutic options are limited during pregnancy as maternal benefit has to be  weighed against fetal risk. Prevention of preterm birth and refractory pregnancy  loss, as well as management of established neonatal heart block remain unmet  needs. Further research should address these important issues that affect young  patients with SLE and their babies.

SP  - 115-9
AB  - Neuropsychiatric (NP) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex entity  comprising 19 different discrete syndromes. We report a case of a 32-year-old  female with SLE and new onset neurological symptoms and radiographic evidence of  a contrast enhancing lesion on brain MRI. The lesion was successfully excised and  found to be granulomatous in nature. Infection and malignant etiologies were  ruled out suggesting that the lesion was due to SLE. Subsequently, the  development of multiple reversible hyperintense signal abnormalities on brain MRI  suggested the possibility of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).  The lesions resolved after the withdrawal of immunosuppression. This article  reviews both the clinical and pathological complexity of PRES in SLE and the  state of the current literature. We conclude that more data is required to  understand the spectrum of PRES and its management in SLE patients.

T1  - Flares of systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy and the puerperium: 
SP  - 439-53
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disease that primarily  affects women in their reproductive age years. Pregnancy in systemic lupus  erythematosus now has favorable outcomes for the majority of women. However,  flares of disease activity, preeclampsia, fetal loss, intrauterine growth  retardation and preterm birth are established risks of such pregnancies. Active  lupus nephritis at the time of conception poses the greatest risk for disease  flares and poor obstetric outcomes. Patients should delay conception until their  lupus has been in remission for at least 6 months. In addition, certain lupus  medications are potentially teratogenic and need to be stopped before conception.  The signs and symptoms of a lupus flare may mimic those of normal pregnancy,  impeding its recognition during pregnancy. Hydroxychloroquine, low-dose  prednisone, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone and azathioprine are commonly  used to treat lupus flares during pregnancy.

T1  - Rituximab: emerging treatment strategies of immune-mediated glomerular disease.
SP  - 413-21
AB  - The use of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of malignancy and autoimmune  diseases has rapidly expanded in the last decade. Rituximab, a monoclonal  antibody to the CD20 antigen on B cells, was first approved by the US FDA in 1997  to treat non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. It is now used, however, for a variety of  diseases in both on- and off-label uses. It was approved by the FDA for use in  refractory rheumatoid arthritis in 2007, and in April 2011 it was approved for  the treatment of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides  (including granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's granulomatosis] and  microscopic polyangiitis), based on the promising results of the RAVE trial.  Within the field of nephrology, in addition to its use in anti-neutrophil  cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides, it is has been used in the  treatment of membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and  lupus nephritis.

T1  - Obstetric nephrology: lupus and lupus nephritis in pregnancy.
SP  - 2089-99
AB  - SLE is a multi-organ autoimmune disease that affects women of childbearing age.  Renal involvement in the form of either active lupus nephritis (LN) at the time  of conception, or a LN new onset or flare during pregnancy increases the risks of  preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, maternal mortality, fetal/neonatal demise, and  intrauterine growth restriction. Consequently, current recommendations advise  that the affected woman achieve a stable remission of her renal disease for at  least 6 months before conception. Hormonal and immune system changes in pregnancy  may affect disease activity and progression, and published evidence suggests that  there is an increased risk for a LN flare during pregnancy. The major goal of  immunosuppressive therapy in pregnancy is control of disease activity with  medications that are relatively safe for a growing fetus. Therefore, the use of  mycophenolate mofetil, due to increasing evidence supporting its teratogenicity,  is contraindicated during pregnancy. Worsening proteinuria, which commonly occurs  in proteinuric renal diseases toward the end of pregnancy, should be  differentiated from a LN flare and/or pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy-specific  condition clinically characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. These  considerations present challenges that underscore the importance of a  multidisciplinary team approach when caring for these patients, including a  nephrologist, rheumatologist, and obstetrician who have experience with these  pregnancy-related complications. This review discusses the pathogenesis, maternal  and fetal risks, and management pertinent to SLE patients with new onset or a  history of LN predating pregnancy.

T1  - Pregnancy and renal outcomes in lupus nephritis: an update and guide to 
SP  - 1271-83
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) commonly affects women of child bearing-age,  and advances in treatment have resulted in an increasing number of women with  renal involvement becoming pregnant. Knowledge of the relationship of the  condition with respect to fertility and pregnancy is important for all clinicians  involved in the care of women with lupus nephritis because they have complicated  pregnancies. Presentation of lupus nephritis can range from mild asymptomatic  proteinuria to rapidly progressive renal failure and may occur before, during, or  after pregnancy. The timing of diagnosis may influence pregnancy outcome.  Pregnancy may also affect the course of lupus nephritis. All pregnancies in women  with lupus nephritis should be planned, preferably after more than six-months of  quiescent disease. Predictors of poor obstetric outcome include active disease at  conception or early pregnancy, baseline poor renal function with Creatinine  >100 mumol/L, proteinuria >0.5 g/24 hours, presence of concurrent antiphospholipid  syndrome and hypertension. In this review the most recent studies of pregnancies  in women with lupus nephritis are discussed and a practical approach to managing  women prepregnancy, during pregnancy and post-partum is described.

T1  - Efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil versus cyclophosphamide for 
SP  - 1521-33
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Whether mycophenolate mofetil is superior to cyclophosphamide as  induction therapy for lupus nephritis (LN) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: Our  objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil  compared with cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for LN patients. METHODS:  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on humans were identified in searches of  PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  (all to 1 December 2011). Studies that compared the efficacy and safety between  mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide as induction therapy in LN patients  were selected. Methodological quality of the included trials was assessed  according to Cochrane criteria and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic  reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The fixed effects model was  applied for pooling where there was no significant heterogeneity, otherwise the  random effects model (Dersimonian and Laird method) was performed. RESULTS: Seven  trials were identified, including 725 patients. The Dersimonian and Laird method  was applied for renal remission in the presence of significant heterogeneity, and  no statistically significant differences were distinguished between mycophenolate  mofetil and cyclophosphamide. To explore the possible source of heterogeneity,  meta-regression was performed. It was suggested that no obvious study- or  patient-level factors could explain interstudy heterogeneity with statistical  significance. Among all these factors, the mode of administration of  cyclophosphamide could explain most of the heterogeneity, although the  coefficient was insignificant. Therefore, we performed a sensitivity analysis by  excluding the trial in which cyclophosphamide was administered orally instead of  intravenously, which suggested that mycophenolate mofetil was more effective than  intravenous cyclophosphamide for inducing complete remission (relative risk [RR]  1.72; 95% CI 1.17, 2.55; p = 0.006) and complete or partial remission (RR 1.18;  95% CI 1.04, 1.35; p = 0.01). In addition, mycophenolate mofetil was superior to  cyclophosphamide for significantly reducing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or  death (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.41, 0.98; p = 0.04). For the safety comparison, lower  risks of leukopenia, amenorrhoea and alopecia, and a higher risk of diarrhoea  were found with mycophenolate mofetil. No statistical differences in infection  and gastrointestinal symptoms were distinguished between mycophenolate mofetil  and cyclophosphamide. The relatively small number and the open-label fashion of  eligible RCTs may limit the value of our meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS:  Mycophenolate mofetil is superior to intravenous cyclophosphamide for inducing  renal remission, and has a significant advantage over cyclophosphamide for  reducing ESRD or death. Furthermore, mycophenolate mofetil has lower risks of  leukopenia, amenorrhoea and alopecia, but a higher risk of diarrhoea than  cyclophosphamide. However, our conclusions need to be proved further in larger  well designed trials.

SP  - 522-33
AB  - Antimalarial agents have routinely been used for the treatment of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) for over 50 years. These agents continue to enjoy success as  the initial pharmacotherapy for SLE even in the era of targeted therapies.  Antimalarial agents have numerous biological effects that are responsible for  their immunomodulatory actions in SLE. Their inhibitory effect on Toll-like  receptor-mediated activation of the innate immune response is perhaps the most  important discovery regarding their putative mechanism of action, but some other,  previously known properties, such as antithrombotic and antilipidaemic effects,  are now explained by new research. In the 1980s and 1990s, these  antihyperlipidaemic and antithrombotic effects were demonstrated in retrospective  clinical studies, and over the past few years prospective studies have confirmed  those findings. Knowledge about the risk-benefit profile of antimalarial agents  during pregnancy and lactation has evolved, as has the concept of retinal  toxicity. Antimalarial agents have unique disease-modifying properties in SLE and  newer iterations of this class of anti-inflammatory agents will have a profound  effect upon the treatment of autoimmune disease.

T1  - B-cell depletion in the treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 505-14
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is  clinically heterogeneous and affects multiple organs. Lupus nephritis is the most  frequent severe manifestation of SLE. Conventional immunosuppressive therapy has  increased the life expectancy of patients diagnosed with lupus nephritis, but  only 70-80% of patients respond to this treatment and its adverse effects are  considerable. B cells are central to the pathogenesis of SLE and are, therefore,  an attractive therapeutic target. B-cell depletion has been used successfully to  treat other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and antineutrophil  cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, and many case reports and small  nonrandomized trials of B-cell-depleting agents in patients with lupus nephritis  have reported positive results. By contrast, two large placebo-controlled trials  designed to investigate the efficacy of the B-cell-depleting agents rituximab and  ocrelizumab as a treatment for lupus nephritis, failed to meet their primary  efficacy end points (LUNAR and BELONG, respectively). This Review discusses the  current evidence on the use of B-cell depletion in the treatment of lupus  nephritis, which is derived from case studies and clinical trials including a  total of over 800 patients.

SP  - 176-82
AB  - In the past 40 years, prognosis for patients with systemic lupus  erythematosusu(SLE) has improved, and 10-year survival now becomes approximately  over 95%. This may be due probably to a combination of earlier disease diagnosis  and diagnosis of milder disease, due in part to availability of multiple  serological tests for SLE, use of steroids and other immunosuppressive agents,  and availability of renal dialysis and transplantation. Although the prognosis of  SLE itself improved a lot, still the potential for significant morbidity and  mortality remains in the group of patients with partially responsive or treatment  resistant disease such as type IV lupus nephritis and CNS involvement, etc. To  overcome these problems, various therapeutic approaches have been newly developed  based on the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis  of SLE. In this paper, usefulness of treatments targeting molecules that are  strongly associated with immune disorders in lupus patients will be discussed.

T1  - Beyond the LUNAR trial. Efficacy of rituximab in refractory lupus nephritis.
SP  - 106-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) remains problematic because the  current treatment regimen based on unspecific immunosuppressants such as  steroids, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate has significant side effects and is  often inefficient. B-cell ablation with the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab  (RTX) has been considered as an alternative treatment option but the randomized  controlled LUNAR trial failed to show any additive effect of RTX beyond a  steroid-mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) combination for LN type III/IV/V in incident  patients. At present, no such trial is available for the use of RTX in refractory  LN. METHODS: We analysed existing evidence on this topic by performing a  systematic analysis of reports that document outcomes of RTX treatment for  refractory LN. RESULTS: Out of 233 reports, we selected 26 for analysis, which  described 300 patients with a mean follow-up of 60 weeks. The complete or partial  response criteria were met by 87% of patients with LN class III, 76% with class  IV and 67% with class V, respectively. Mixed classes responded in 76% of  patients. RTX induced complete responses in 60% (type III), 45% (type IV), 40%  (type V) and 24% (mixed types), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review  of existing evidence suggests that RTX effectively induces remission of LN in  patients who have not achieved remission with standard therapies. Another  randomized controlled trial should be conducted to test the efficacy of RTX in  refractory LN.

SP  - 413-25
AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may complicate diverse connective tissue  diseases (CTDs). Approximately 10% of patients with systemic sclerosis develop  PAH, the prevalence being much lower in other CTDs. However, PAH is an important  contributor to morbidity and mortality in all forms of CTD. Despite similarities  in presentation, hemodynamic perturbations, and pathogenesis, patients with  CTD-associated PAH (CTD-PAH) usually have a poorer response to PAH-specific  medications and poorer prognosis than patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH). Select  patients with CTD-PAH may be candidates for lung transplantation, but results are  less favorable than for IPAH because of comorbidities and complications  specifically associated with CTD.

SP  - 1256-60
AB  - Available treatments for severe (class III, IV, and V) lupus nephritis (LN) have  expanded greatly over the last 40 years. In the 1970s and 1980s, cyclophosphamide  (CYC), in combination with glucocorticoids, gained favor as induction and  maintenance therapy for severe LN. However, the adverse event profile of CYC led  to the search for other medications for severe LN. Beginning in the late 1990 s,  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was introduced as induction and maintenance therapy  for severe LN. This review discusses the clinical trial results, pharmacology,  cost-effectiveness, and adverse effect profiles of CYC compared to MMF for  induction and maintenance therapy for severe LN. The authors conclude that MMF  should be considered first-line induction and maintenance treatment therapy for  severe LN, although CYC may have a place under specific clinical and economic  circumstances.

AB  - Proliferative lupus nephritis is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Despite improvements in the  management of lupus nephritis, a significant number of the patients do not  respond to immunosuppressive therapy and progress to end-stage renal failure. In  order to optimise the diagnostic strategy and treatment of patients with  proliferative lupus nephritis, guidelines are needed. In this review, the Dutch  Working Party on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus provides recommendations regarding  four important areas in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis: I)  indications for a first renal biopsy, II ) definitions of treatment response, III  ) selection of treatment options, and IV) indications for a repeat biopsy.

T1  - Urine biomarkers in juvenile-onset SLE nephritis.
SP  - 363-74
AB  - Over 80 % of patients with juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus will have  renal involvement compared to 40 % with adult-onset disease. Up to 44 % of  children who do have lupus nephritis (LN) progress to renal failure in early  adulthood. Improved methods of detecting onset of LN would allow earlier  treatment, which may prevent irreversible renal scarring and a decline in renal  function. Current conventional markers of disease activity fail to adequately  predict renal lupus flares and include proteinuria, complement levels,  anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and serum creatinine concentrations.  Standardized histological classification is currently the gold standard for  diagnosing and classifying LN, but its invasive nature limits routine use for  monitoring, especially in a childhood population. Novel biomarkers need to be  sensitive and specific-and preferably non-invasive and cost-effective. The most  promising biomarkers in juvenile-onset LN include urinary neutrophil gelatinase  associated lipocalin, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and transforming growth  factor-beta, although many others have been identified and are under  investigation. No one biomarker yet discovered is unique to LN, indicating an  overlap in disease pathophysiology. It is likely that a combination of biomarkers  will be required for assessing disease flare detection, response to treatment and  prognostic information. Potential biomarkers require longitudinal validation in  large paediatric, prospective cohorts to assess their ability to act as  clinically useful adjuncts.

T1  - Recent progress in the treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 803-13
AB  - The treatment of lupus nephritis has seen significant advances during the past  decade mainly due to the publication of well-designed randomized clinical trials  (RCTs). The choice of treatment is guided by the histopathologic classification  but is also influenced by demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics  that allow for the identification of patients at risk for more aggressive  disease. For the induction arm, low-dose cyclophosphamide regimens and  mycophenolate mofetil have been validated as alternatives to the established  National Institutes of Health regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide; for the  maintenance phase, azathioprine and mycophenolate compete for treatment of first  choice. Rituximab is efficacious in real-life clinical practice but ineffective  in clinical trials. The role of recently approved belimumab in lupus nephritis  eagerly awaits further documentation. Aggressive management of comorbid  conditions, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is of utmost importance. Here,  we review the latest advances in lupus nephritis therapy with a focus on recent  RCTs as well as new biologic agents under development. Furthermore, we propose a  therapeutic algorithm in an effort to facilitate clinical decision-making in this  gradually changing landscape. Upcoming European and American recommendations  should provide further clarification.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus in children and adolescents.
SP  - 345-64
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease with a wide  range of disease manifestations that can involve any organ system, and can lead  to significant morbidity and even mortality. This article reviews the  epidemiology, common clinical features, and complications of the disease, and  briefly discusses the available treatment options. In addition, important medical  and psychosocial issues relevant to the pediatrician caring for children and  adolescents with SLE are discussed.

T1  - Belimumab is approved by the FDA: what more do we need to know to optimize 
SP  - 318-23
AB  - The March 2011 approval of belimumab (Benlysta) by the US Food and Drug  Administration has left rheumatologists in a bit of a quandary regarding its use.  It is officially intended for adult patients with autoantibody-positive systemic  lupus erythematosus whose disease remains active despite receipt of  standard-of-care therapy. The approved indication is broad and leaves  interpretation to individual rheumatologists. Analyses of the phase 2 and 3  clinical trials of belimumab help answer some of the commonly asked questions,  such as the following: 1) Who is the appropriate patient for belimumab? 2) How  does one measure response? 3) When should results be expected in a patient newly  treated with belimumab? 4) When should belimumab be discontinued?

T1  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension in systemic lupus erythematosus: current status 
SP  - 854941
AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is commonly associated with connective  tissue diseases (CTDs) including systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). The prevalence of PAH in SLE is estimated to be 0.5% to  17.5%. The pathophysiology of PAH involves multiple mechanisms from vasculitis  and in-situ thrombosis to interstitial pulmonary fibrosis which increases  pulmonary vascular resistance, potentially leading to right heart failure. Immune  and inflammatory mechanisms may play a significant role in the pathogenesis or  progression of PAH in patients with CTDs, establishing a role for  anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive therapies. The leading predictors of PAH  in SLE are Raynaud phenomenon, anti-U1RNP antibody, and anticardiolipin antibody  positivity. The first-line of diagnostic testing for patients with suspected  SLE-associated PAH (SLE-aPAH) involves obtaining a Doppler echocardiogram. Once  the diagnosis is confirmed by right heart catheterization, SLE-aPAH patients are  generally treated with oxygen, anticoagulants, and vasodilators. Although the  prognosis and therapeutic responsiveness of these patients have improved with the  addition of intensive immunosuppressive therapies, these treatments are still  largely unproven. Recent data put the one-year survival rate for SLE-aPAH  patients at 94%. Pregnant women are most at risk of dying due to undiagnosed  SLE-aPAH, and screening should be considered essential in this population.

T1  - B-cell targeted treatments for lupus: the journey counts as much as the 
SP  - 437-40
AB  - Obstacles facing therapeutic trials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include  the low incidence, seriousness, complexity, and clinical polymorphism of the  disease. A large-scale multicenter design has been required in most cases. Over  the last few years, several biologics have been evaluated as treatments for lupus  nephritis or for the skin and joint manifestations of SLE. The central role for  the B-cell in SLE, together with improved knowledge of the targets on the B-cell  surface, has prompted efforts to develop monoclonal antibodies as treatments for  SLE. The two available monoclonal antibodies are rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody)  and belimumab (anti-BlyS antibody). The results obtained with belimumab were used  to develop a new measurement tool, the SLE Responder Index (SRI), and prompted an  application for a license to use belimumab in SLE. Other targets identified on  the B-cell surface are being evaluated.

T1  - Belimumab: review of use in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1006-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits B-lymphocyte  stimulating protein, was the first biologic agent approved for, and the first  drug approved in 55 years for, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OBJECTIVE: This article  reviews the current research on belimumab and provides recommendations on its use  in the treatment of SLE. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, EBSCO, IPA, MEDLINE, and  SCOPUS were searched for research published from January 2000 to November 2011,  using the search terms belimumab, Benlysta, and Lympho-Stat B. Selection criteria  included peer-reviewed original research articles on the pharmacology,  pharmacokinetic properties, drug interactions, and clinical efficacy and  tolerability of belimumab in the treatment of SLE. Abstracts from the annual  meetings of major rheumatology medical organizations and societies were searched  and reviewed for new content. Additional information on belimumab was obtained  from the manufacturer, from the FDA, and from other sources. MEDLINE was also  used to select clinical studies and therapeutic guidelines on SLE therapy.  RESULTS: The literature search identified 1 Phase II and 2 Phase III studies that  compared belimumab (1, 4, and 10 mg/kg/dose IV on days 0, 14, and 28; then every  28 days) to placebo in patients with active SLE on concurrent therapies. Patients  with active lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus were excluded. In a Phase  II, 52-week study, 24-week mean Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus  National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index  (SELENA-SLEDAI) scores were decreased by 19.5% with belimumab versus 17.2% with  placebo (P = NS). Median time to first flare was 67 days with belimumab versus 83  days with placebo (P = NS). In seropositive patients, 52-week mean SELENA-SLEDAI  scores were decreased by 28.8% with belimumab versus 14.2% with placebo (P <  0.05), and physician's global assessment scores were improved by 32.7% with  belimumab versus 10.7% with placebo (P < 0.05). Two Phase III studies were  performed in seropositive SLE patients. In a Phase III, 52-week study, the rates  of response (a reduction of >/=4 points on the SLE Response Index [SRI]) at week 52  were 51% and 58% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose, respectively, versus 44%  with placebo (both, P < 0.05). In a Phase III, 76-week study, the rates of  response, as measured using SRI, at week 52 were 42.8% and 46.5% with belimumab 1  and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 35.3% with placebo (P = NS and P < 0.001); at 76 weeks,  response rates were 42.1% and 41.4% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus  33.8% with placebo (P < 0.05 and P = NS). The tolerability data from these  studies did not suggest any overall differences between belimumab and placebo.  CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings from the present review, belimumab appears to  be efficacious and generally well-tolerated and in the treatment of SLE other  than lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus. Additional clinical and economics  studies are needed to determine the most appropriate place for belimumab in the  treatment of SLE.

T1  - Successful treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) 
SP  - 1119-23
AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is a known manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus.  However, the association of primary autoimmune inflammatory neuropathies such as  chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) with SLE is uncommon. We  report a 26-year-old man who simultaneously presented with severe CIDP and  photosensitive rash, but was unresponsive to intravenous immunoglobulin infusion  and continued to progress. He was found to have underlying SLE and improved with  combined corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy with oral cyclophosphamide.  CIDP with underlying SLE may be more resistant to conventional therapy with IVIG,  requiring the addition of other immunosuppressive agents.

T1  - [Management of antiphospholipid syndrome].
SP  - 217-22
AB  - The prevention of thrombosis in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) remains  controversial. The purpose of this review is to provide updated recommendations.  There is evidence that patients at risk of thrombosis are those with "a pattern  of high risk antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL)" (presence of a lupus  anticoagulant [LA], association of several aPL, or persistent aCL at a medium or  high level), or those with associated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The  prescription of aspirin in primary prevention is recommended in SLE patients with  positive LA or persistent aCL at a significant level. Secondary prevention is  based on a very prolonged anticoagulation. An INR around 2.5 seems to be  sufficient in patients with venous APS. In case of arterial events, the attitude  is debated. We propose to maintain a target INR between 3 and 3.5. The possible  occurrence of relapse despite anticoagulation in the therapeutic target may lead  to the addition of aspirin. The development of new anti-thrombotic agents might  change the management of APS in the coming years.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic syndrome with unknown etiology  and polymorphic clinical picture occurring mainly in women. The patients have  immunological abnormalities such as autoantibodies against nuclear structures.  The prognosis has improved due to active early diagnostics and more efficient  treatment of the disease. Mild forms of the disease are associated with fatigue,  articular and muscular symptoms, skin rashes, pleuritis or pericarditis and minor  changes in the blood. Severe SLE involves glomerulonephritis, complications in  the central nervous system, cardiac and pulmonary complications and major changes  in the blood.

T1  - Maternal deaths in women with lupus nephritis: a review of published evidence.
SP  - 534-41
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pregnancies in women with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) and lupus nephritis are considered high-risk due to high rates of maternal  and fetal complications. However, there has not been a formal analysis addressing  the issue of maternal deaths in these women. The aim of this study was to perform  a literature review of the maternal deaths in women with SLE and lupus nephritis  to: (1) identify the main causes of death and (2) discuss possible reasons for  these causes, and strategies that may improve patient care and outcomes. DESIGN,  SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENT: We performed an extensive electronic  literature search from 1962 to 2009 using online databases (PubMed, Embase,  Lilacs, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, and Science Citation  Index). Studies were included if they reported pregnancies in patients with SLE  and lupus nephritis with at least one reported maternal death. RESULTS: We  identified 13 studies that reported a total of 17 deaths in the 6 week  post-partum period that were attributable to SLE and lupus nephritis. In all  cases, death occurred in the setting of active disease, and was attributed either  to infection in 41.2% (n = 7), or disease activity in 29.4% (n = 5). The  remaining deaths were due to pulmonary embolus in 11.8% (n = 2),  pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy in 5.9% (n = 1), adrenal failure due to  abrupt steroid withdrawal in 5.9% (n = 1), and undefined in 5.9% (n = 1).  CONCLUSIONS: All maternal deaths in patients with SLE and lupus nephritis  occurred in those with active disease, with disease activity/complications and  infections (mainly opportunistic) being the two major causes. The presented  evidence further supports timing of pregnancy relative to SLE activity, and the  judicious use of immunosuppressive agents in pregnant patients.

T1  - Therapy of lupus nephritis: lessons learned from clinical research and daily care 
SP  - 202
AB  - Despite numerous randomized clinical trials over the last three decades for  identifying the optimal treatment option for lupus nephritis, renal involvement  still significantly impacts the survival and quality of life of patients with  lupus and the search for the ideal immunosuppressive regimen is far from  complete. The purpose of this review is to summarize the major recent  achievements in the field. More specifically, the following topics will be  discussed: intravenous cyclophosphamide versus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for  induction; azathioprine versus MMF for maintenance; targeted therapies. The  review will address clues for optimal global care, such as the need for complete  initial evaluation, the importance of patient education, the unmasking of  non-compliance to therapy, the reason for an early treatment switch in  non-responding patients, the need for prolonged immunosuppression, optimal renal  protection, and prevention of cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities.

T1  - Drug-induced vasculitis: a clinical and pathological review.
SP  - 12-7
AB  - Drug-induced vasculitis is an inflammation of blood vessels caused by the use of  various pharmaceutical agents. Vasculitis causes changes in the walls of blood  vessels, including thickening, weakening, narrowing and scarring. Inflammation  can be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic) and can be so severe that the  tissues and organs supplied by the affected vessels do not get enough blood. The  shortage of blood can result in organ and tissue damage, even death. Drug-induced  vasculitis is the most common form of vasculitis. The differential diagnosis  between drug-induced and idiopathic vasculitic conditions may be difficult in the  individual patient. Withdrawal may be helpful to distinguish between these  syndromes. Withdrawal of the offending agent alone is often sufficient to induce  prompt resolution of clinical manifestations, obviating the need for  immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs. Increasing understanding of the  pathophysiological characteristics of all inflammatory vasculitides should lead  to better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to drug-induced vasculitis.

We report a case and review the literature of  successful PEA for CTEPH due to antiphospholipid syndrome associated with  systemic lupus erythematosus. The definitive and decisive approach needed to  treat this high-risk patient with a history of comorbidity, long-term illness and  poor compliance was found with a therapy of PEA.

T1  - [Renal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 260-6
AB  - Renal involvement is frequent (20 to 50% of cases) during the course of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). It significantly influences the functional prognosis  and the patient survival. Glomerulopathy is the usual renal lesion in SLE and the  clinical presentation can be very polymorphic, ranging from isolated proteinuria  to nephrotic syndrome or rapidly progressive renal failure. The severity of the  renal disease and the overall prognosis can vary according to the patient's  ethnicity but the main prognostic factor is the response of the disease to the  initial immunosuppressive therapy. Renal biopsy is essential for classifying the  glomerular lesions, establish the prognosis and guide the clinician in the choice  of the right therapeutic scheme. The induction therapy of lupus proliferative  glomerulonephritis asssociates high-dose corticosteroids and an immunosuppressive  treatment. Cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are the most used  immunosuppressive drugs in this setting. After remission, the treatment is  classically switched to a combination of low-dose corticosteroids and oral  immunosuppression with azathioprine or MMF, combined with long-term  hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis.

T1  - Lupus arthritis--do we have a clinically useful classification?
SP  - 771-9
AB  - Joint disease in SLE is common and has a significant impact on patients in terms  of their burden of disease and quality of life. Despite this it remains largely  understudied in comparison with the other inflammatory arthropathies. Newer  imaging techniques are challenging the traditional concepts of a non-erosive  arthropathy that is outlined in the ACR diagnostic criteria for SLE. MRI and  musculoskeletal US techniques have been applied extensively in RA to detail the  underlying joint pathology, to monitor response to treatment and to guide  prognosis. The advent of biological therapies has revolutionized the treatment of  RA and has again been borne out of an abundance of research that exists  surrounding the underlying pathobiological inflammatory pathways. Unfortunately,  no such unified body of evidence exists for lupus arthritis, which has made the  development of an appropriate classification system somewhat difficult as our  understanding remains incomplete.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus: a genetic review for advanced practice nurses.
SP  - 629-37
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the symptom presentation, genetic aspects, and available  treatment options for individuals diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). Primary care providers should be vigilant in identifying symptoms, which  may be related to SLE, perform adequate assessment, and diagnostic testing in  order to arrive at an early diagnosis. DATA SOURCES: Extensive literature review  of textbook, clinical, medical, and nursing journals. CONCLUSIONS: Lupus is a  multigenic autoimmune disease, which requires the clinician to be hypervigilant  by collecting a thorough family history and performing a complete physical  assessment of the patient. There is an array of treatment modalities, both  experimental and proven therapies, which improve signs and symptoms associated  with SLE. Numerous medications are available for symptom management:  anti-inflammatory agents for patients with musculoskeletal presentation, and  steroids or antimalarials for those with more extensive organ involvement.  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In SLE, the overall aim of management is to determine  the extent of disease and prevent extensive organ involvement. Therefore, when  diagnosed in a timely manner, most patients will survive and are able to manage  their disease.

T1  - Belimumab: in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 2435-44
AB  - Belimumab is a fully human recombinant IgG1lambda monoclonal antibody that inhibits  the binding of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator to B cells and hence prevents the  survival and differentiation of selected B-cell subsets. It is available in the  US, the EU and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with active,  autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of  disease activity despite receiving standard therapy. At 52 weeks, a significantly  greater proportion of belimumab 10 mg/kg than placebo recipients experienced a  response as assessed by the SLE Responder Index (primary endpoint) in the  randomized, double-blind, multinational, phase III BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 trials  in patients with active seropositive SLE receiving standard therapy. A  significantly greater proportion of belimumab than placebo recipients achieved a  >/=4 point reduction in the SELENA-SLEDAI score at week 52 in both BLISS trials.  However, the SLE Responder Index response rate was not significantly different  between belimumab and placebo at 76 weeks in BLISS-76. Belimumab was generally  well tolerated in the BLISS trials. During the double-blind periods of these  trials and the phase II trial, twice as many deaths were reported with belimumab  than placebo (six vs three). There were no meaningful differences between the  incidence of serious infections and malignancies with belimumab or placebo.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an uncommon disease in children and  adolescents but far from being unknown. The disease's symptoms are often  non-specific and vague at first and clinicians must suspect SLE without the more  specific symptoms. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible to delay or  prevent serious complications. This case demonstrates the history of a young boy  who needed medical attention at the Children's Hospital of Iceland because of  joint pain, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue. The epidemiology, diagnostic  criteria, treatment and prognosis of children diagnosed with SLE are reviewed.

SP  - 353-64
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare but severe manifestation of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can ultimately result in death. The  identification of factors that prognosticate survival in SLE-PH is necessary for  appropriate monitoring, timing of therapeutics and lung transplantation. The  primary objective of this study was to identify prognostic factors for survival  in SLE-PH through review of the literature. The methodological quality of the  prognostic studies was also evaluated. METHODS: A systematic review of the  literature was performed to identify studies evaluating prognostic factors for  survival in SLE-PH. Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Registry of  Controlled Trials (inception - week 2 2010) were searched. A standardized  abstraction form was used by two independent reviewers to extract prognostic  factors. Methodological quality was evaluated using a validated quality index.  RESULTS: Twenty-three observational studies from 375 citations were evaluated.  Elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure, Raynaud's phenomenon, thrombocytopenia,  plexiform lesion, infection, thrombosis, pregnancy, pulmonary vasculitis and  anticardiolipin antibodies were associated with decreased survival. Lupus disease  activity, nephritis and central nervous system disease were not associated with  survival. The sample sizes were small and methodological quality of the studies  was variable. CONCLUSION: This study summarizes factors that may be associated  with decreased survival in SLE-PH. The small sample sizes and variable  methodological quality preclude definitive conclusions. This study provides the  groundwork for further research using large cohorts.

T1  - Balancing efficacy and toxicity of novel therapies in systemic lupus 
SP  - 437-51
AB  - Therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus has been facing the paradox of an  overwhelming rate of trials testing novel potential therapeutic agents and the  lack of US FDA approval of a single new drug for over five decades. Heterogeneity  in disease phenotype, concomitant immunosuppressive medication and a lack of  unequivocal hard end points for clinical trials have proven to be significant  obstacles in establishing efficacy of candidate therapies. Nevertheless,  combination regimens with already existing agents have shown efficacy with  acceptable safety profiles, mainly in cases of refractory to conventional  treatment disease. At the same time, positive results from trials with belimumab,  an antibody that targets B cells, opened the way for approval of this agent for  the treatment of lupus and lends hope for a new era in systemic lupus  erythematosus therapeutics. Here, we review the latest advances in systemic lupus  erythematosus therapy, focusing on the balance between efficacy and safety for  combination therapeutic regimens and biologics under development.

T1  - Lupus and pregnancy.
SP  - 639-53
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disproportionately affects women in their  reproductive age years. Pregnancy in this systemic autoimmune disease has long  been associated with poor obstetric outcomes. However, the frequency of pregnancy  loss in lupus has dropped to a level commensurate with that of the general US  population. The outcomes of lupus pregnancies are better if conception is delayed  until the disease has been inactive for at least 6 months, and the medication  regimen has been adjusted in advance. Pregnancy in lupus is prone to  complications, including flares of disease activity during pregnancy or in the  postpartum period, preeclampsia, miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine growth  retardation, and preterm birth. Active lupus nephritis poses the greatest risk.  The recognition of a lupus flare during pregnancy may be difficult because the  signs and symptoms may mimic those of normal pregnancy. Monitoring should include  baseline and monthly laboratory tests, serial ultrasonography, fetal surveillance  tests, and fetal m-mode echocardiography for mothers with SS-A (Ro) or SS-B (La)  antibodies. In the absence of any signs or symptoms of active SLE, affected  patients require no specific treatment during pregnancy. If hydroxychloroquine  was in use before conception, it should be maintained throughout pregnancy. If a  woman with SLE has antiphospholipid antibodies, prophylactic treatment with  aspirin and/or low-molecular weight heparin is indicated to prevent fetal loss.  Lupus flares during pregnancy are generally treated with hydroxychloroquine,  low-dose prednisone, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone, and azathioprine.  High-dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide are reserved for severe lupus  complications but are associated with significant pregnancy-related complications  and poor obstetrical outcomes.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be a severe and potentially  life-threatening disease that often represents a therapeutic challenge because of  its heterogeneous organ manifestations. Only glucocorticoids, chloroquine and  hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and very recently belimumab  have been approved for SLE therapy in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  Dependence on glucocorticoids and resistance to the approved therapeutic agents,  as well as substantial toxicity, are frequent. Therefore, treatment  considerations will include 'off-label' use of medication approved for other  indications. In this consensus approach, an effort has been undertaken to  delineate the limits of the current evidence on therapeutic options for SLE organ  disease, and to agree on common practice. This has been based on the best  available evidence obtained by a rigorous literature review and the authors' own  experience with available drugs derived under very similar health care  conditions. Preparation of this consensus document included an initial meeting to  agree upon the core agenda, a systematic literature review with subsequent  formulation of a consensus and determination of the evidence level followed by  collecting the level of agreement from the panel members. In addition to  overarching principles, the panel have focused on the treatment of major SLE  organ manifestations (lupus nephritis, arthritis, lung disease, neuropsychiatric  and haematological manifestations, antiphospholipid syndrome and serositis). This  consensus report is intended to support clinicians involved in the care of  patients with difficult courses of SLE not responding to standard therapies by  providing up-to-date information on the best available evidence.

SP  - 225-9
AB  - Three years after the approval of the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor antibody  tocilizumab in the U.S. for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, data has  continued to accumulate that can help guide its use for this indication. In  particular, the structural benefit of therapy, previously shown in Japanese  studies, has been confirmed in non-Japanese populations. Additional studies have  identified markers, such as high titer rheumatoid factor, that may be associated  with greater clinical response to this agent. While registry data with this  therapy have not yet become available, more detailed analyses of clinical trial  data have helped clarify the risk for certain toxicities, including infection and  gastrointestinal perforation. Importantly, data have become available supporting  the use of tocilizumab in diseases other than adult RA. Large clinical trials in  systemic juvenile inflammatory arthritis have led to the approval of tocilizumab  for this indication, and preliminary data suggests benefit in adult onset Still's  disease. Finally, there is interest in the potential of IL-6 inhibition in other  diseases, although meaningful data has not yet become available.

SP  - 381-4
AB  - Hematologic disorders are common in autoimmune diseases. First presentation of  systemic lupus erythematosis with aplastic anemia is extremely rare. We report a  patient with the diagnosis of secondary aplastic anemia associated with lupus.  All routine medications were not effective. She received Rituximab and her  response was satisfactory. Her hematologic parameters were within normal range  until last follow-up, six months after therapy was initiated with Rituximab.  Review of literature displayed 23 cases of acquired aplastic anemia secondary to  systemic lupus erythematosis; however, this is the first time the new drug  therapy was used for the treatment.

T1  - [Systemic autoimmune disorders and pregnancy].
SP  - 1715-23
AB  - The coincidence of systemic autoimmune diseases and pregnancy may modify the  outcome of the disease and the pregnancy due to the background immunologic and  hormonal processes. The great majority of patients with autoimmune diseases are  young females in their reproductive years, willing to have babies. Consequently,  we have to prepare for this special situation. Our concept on childbearing in  autoimmune women has changed within the last 30 years. Earlier, systemic lupus  erythematosus flared in about 50% of patients during pregnancy, but the flare  rate has significantly decreased recently. This improvement can be attributed to  increased attention to low diseases activity at the time of conception, which  might reduce to the half of the risk for flare. Tight control of patients and  appropriate use of corticosteroids also contribute to the better results. The  adequate use of anti-thrombotic agents resulted in a significant amelioration of  pregnancy outcome in antiphospholipid syndrome. The earlier use of methotrexate  and the introduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in the treatment  of rheumatoid arthritis have changed the natural characteristics of the disease.  The increase in remission rate indirectly has beneficial effect on the number of  planned and carried out pregnancies. Authors review the connection between  systemic autoimmune disorders and pregnancy as well as the possibilities of  medical treatment of such diseases during pregnancy.

T1  - The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index (SRI); a new SLE disease 
SP  - 326-9
AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), because of its complex and multisystemic  presentation, lacks a reliable and sensitive gold standard for measuring disease  activity. In addition, there is no standardized method for defining response to  therapy. Several disease activity indices have been developed over the years,  each with their own positive and negative aspects. Growing insight in the  pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like SLE leads to the introduction of  specific targeted biologic therapies. To investigate the efficacy of these new  biologic agents, disease activity must be monitored regularly by a reliable and  validated instrument. Recent studies on new biologics for treatment of SLE use a  new composite measurement for disease activity and response in SLE. This new  disease activity assessment, called SLE Responder Index (SRI), comprises criteria  from three different internationally validated indices, SELENA-SLE Disease  Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), Physician Global Assessment (PGA) and the British  Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004. This review gives an overview of  current available disease activity indices in relation to the newly developed  composite SRI.

SP  - 2993-7
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus predominantly affects young women during  childbearing age. It is rare after the age of 90, and there is no report of very  late onset in persons over 90 in China. Here, we reported a case of a female  patient, the onset age of whom was 90, analyzing her clinical features and  treatments. And when conducting a pooled analysis of late-onset cases in the  literature, we found that the organ damages and severity of lupus disease of  old-onset SLE were not benign, and considering their ages, comorbidities and high  rate of mortalities, appropriate interventions and close follow-up for this age  group are needed.

T1  - [Changes in mortality and morbidity in systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 480-5
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic multisystem disease and despite  the improvements in treatment, long-term care still represents a clinical  challenge. Previous long-running studies have demonstrated a continuous  improvement in mortality and this trend has persisted over the last two decades.  However, there still remains a significantly increased mortality in comparison to  the normal population. Besides deaths caused by disease activity, cardiovascular  and infectious diseases also play a major role. While deaths caused by SLE  activity or infections have declined over the years, there has been a notable  increase in cardiovascular diseases. As the improvement of SLE activity and  infections can be traced back to individually optimized treatment regimes and the  more cautious use of steroids, the cardiovascular complications are due to  accelerated atherosclerosis and the improved survival with ageing of the  patients. This long-term aspect needs to be taken into account in the early  stages of disease when treating disease activity and comorbidities.

AB  - B-cells abnormalities leading to autoantibody production play a central role in  Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. B-cell targeted therapies,  including anti-B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and anti-CD20 monoclonal  antibodies, are at forefront of new SLE treatments. Biologic agents targeting  specific pathways (i.e. T-B lymphocyte interaction, cytokines and complement)  have been also proposed as new tools for SLE treatment. In this review we will  focus on biological drugs whose potential efficacy has been evaluated in  open-label and randomized clinical trials.

T1  - Measuring outcomes in systemic lupus erythematosus clinical trials.
SP  - 455-68
AB  - The recent approval of the biologic therapy, belimumab, for treatment of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) by the US FDA has shifted the developmental landscape  of therapeutics for this autoimmune disease. Promising therapies are currently in  development for the treatment of SLE, with trials designed to emphasize  clinically relevant end points. This article will discuss outcome measures that  have been utilized including disease activity indices, definitions of flare,  measures of damage, global assessments of disease activity and measures of  health-related quality of life. Application of these outcome measures in recent  trials are highlighted as illustrative examples. Contributions to the recent  success of randomized controlled trials in SLE have included use of  evidence-based responder indices, clear definitions of treatment failure,  predefined management strategies for use of immunosuppressive agents and  corticosteroids, sufficient sample sizes and efforts to identify responsive  patient populations. Each completed study in SLE promises to better inform trial  design and offer further opportunities for success in a field with a continuing  unmet therapeutic need.

SP  - 708-11
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) co-morbid with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is  known as 'Rhupus syndrome' and is estimated to be present in between 0.01 and 2%  of SLE and RA patients. The occurrence of aplastic anaemia in a patient with  rhupus is very rare and a treatment for this condition has not been reported. A  52-year-old woman presented complaining of nausea and dizziness during the  preceding month. She had been treated for rheumatoid arthritis for 16 years. At  the time of presentation, she had a malar rash, multiple arthritis, pancytopenia,  pleural effusion, proteinuria, and positive anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA  antibodies. A kidney biopsy revealed ISN/RPS class IV-G (A) lupus nephritis. Bone  marrow aspiration and biopsy showed aplastic anaemia with no evidence of viral  infection. The patient was successfully treated using cyclosporine and  prednisolone and she remained symptom-free at the one-and-a-half-year follow-up.  To our knowledge, this is the first report of a successful treatment using  cyclosporine in a patient with rhupus complicated by aplastic anaemia.

SP  - 3285-90
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and small-sized vessel vasculitis are usually  two distinguishable autoimmune diseases. However, a vasculitis may be found in  the course SLE but rarely corresponds to an ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). We  report four cases of de novo SLE associated with AAV, our aim being to discuss  the clinical significance of this association. We included four patients  fulfilling the criteria for both SLE and AAV and followed in two different  university hospitals between 1996 and 2009. In light of a 20-year literature  review (25 described clinical cases), we discussed the etiopathogeny of such an  association. All patients presented a severe renal involvement (creatininemia  ranging from 120 to 370 mumol/l) and thrombopenia (ranging from 45,000 to 137,000  platelets/mm(3)). The other main clinical symptoms were arthritis (n = 3),  serositis (n = 2) and intra-alveolar hemorrhage (n = 2). An inflammatory syndrome  was noticed at diagnosis in all cases. ANCAs were MPO-ANCAs in all cases. Two out  of these four patients were also diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. The  frequency of this association seems not fortuitous. Although the etiopathogenic  mechanisms of such an association remain to be more precisely described, several  clinical, histological and immunological features support the hypothesis of the  existence of a SLE-AAV overlapping syndrome. Moreover, clinicians must be aware  of such an overlapping syndrome, notably because its initial presentation can be  very severe.

T1  - Dietary factors regulate cytokines in murine models of systemic lupus 
SP  - 22-7
AB  - Cytokines play the active roles in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and contribute significantly to the immune imbalance in this  disease. Conservative therapeutic approaches, such as dietary modifications have  been shown to have some beneficial impact on the disease activity of the SLE.  Over the past years, accumulating evidences have supported a major role for  specific dietary factors, including calorie restriction, n-3/n-6 fatty acids,  vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, phytoestrogens or herbal medicine in the  regulation of cytokines involved in SLE development. Although there are many  reviews that discuss the issue of nutrition and immunity, there are relatively  few articles that focus on the regulation of cytokines by dietary factors. This  concise review will summarize those animal studies that investigated not only the  outcome of autoantibody production and proteinuria, but also cytokines  production. However, the field of dietary factors in the immunomodulation of SLE  is still in its infancy. More clinical studies are needed to confirm the  preliminary results and advance the knowledge in this field. Lifestyle  modification and adjustments in diet are important and encouraged to be suggested  as an adjuvant therapy for SLE.

T1  - Mycophenolate mofetil in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 454-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Clinicians are increasingly using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This review will discuss  the key studies that have contributed to our understanding of the efficacy and  safety of MMF in the treatment of SLE. RECENT FINDINGS: The Aspreva Lupus  Management Study (ALMS) firmly established that MMF is equivalent to intravenous  pulse cyclophosphamide (IVC) for the induction treatment of lupus nephritis. In  addition, MMF was shown to be superior to azathioprine in decreasing the  incidence of treatment failure during maintenance therapy. A posthoc analysis of  the induction phase of ALMS suggested that MMF also improved nonrenal  manifestations of SLE. In contrast to the ALMS maintenance results, a European  trial concluded that MMF and azathioprine were equivalent in the ability to  prevent renal flare after induction treatment with low-dose IVC. SUMMARY:  Favorable efficacy and safety results of several clinical trials conducted over  the past 10 years have led to the adoption of MMF for the treatment of lupus  nephritis and nonrenal lupus. Future research will be important to more fully  understand the best dosing regimen of MMF for induction versus maintenance  treatment, total duration of treatment, and the utility of therapeutic monitoring  of MMF levels.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the classical systemic autoimmune disease.  Its prevalence is slightly below 1:1,000 in women and 10-fold lower in men.  Typically, the disease manifests in women of childbearing age. While severe  untreated SLE used to be a fatal disease, prognosis has improved stepwise with  corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and novel therapies. Deaths directly related to  SLE are uncommon nowadays but infections, thromboses and accelerated  atherosclerosis cause significant problems. The current review presents the state  of the art in managing SLE patients.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder  affecting mainly ectodermal and mesodermal tissues. It is well known that  patients with NF1 have an increased risk of developing benign and malignant  tumors, but its association with autoimmune diseases has been rarely reported.  Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease that  has the potential to affect various organ systems. There are four cases with NF1  and SLE reported in the literature up to date. Here, we report a 9-year-old girl  presenting with NF1 and SLE, and to our knowledge, this is the first childhood  case in the literature.

T1  - Treatment of lupus: impact on quality of life.
SP  - 324-37
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that  disproportionately affects women of childbearing age during their most productive  years. Current therapeutic measures have improved patient survival; however, the  impact of interventions on general and specific domains of health-related quality  of life requires further study. Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36),  the most commonly used measure, has been included in some SLE randomized  controlled trials, but the observed effect sizes were generally small and in some  cases negligible. An SLE patient's quality of life is known to be significantly  worse than that of someone in the general population and perhaps worse than those  with most other common chronic diseases. SF-36, although useful as a general  measure, may not be the most sensitive way to gauge changes perceived by patients  with SLE. Ongoing trials and observational longitudinal studies using  lupus-specific health-related quality-of-life measures may help better determine  health-related quality-of-life responses and determine the domains most amenable  to interventions.

T1  - Preliminary criteria for global flares in childhood-onset systemic lupus 
SP  - 1213-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop widely acceptable preliminary criteria of global flare for  childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE). METHODS: Pediatric  rheumatologists (n = 138) rated a total of 358 unique patient profiles with  information about the cSLE flare descriptors from 2 consecutive visits: patient  global assessment of well-being, physician global assessment of disease activity  (MD-global), health-related quality of life, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies,  disease activity index scores, protein:creatinine (P:C) ratio, complement levels,  and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Based on 2,996 rater responses about  the course of cSLE (baseline versus followup), the accuracy (sensitivity,  specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of  candidate flare criteria was assessed. An international consensus conference was  held to rank these candidate flare criteria as per the American College of  Rheumatology recommendations for the development and validation of criteria sets.  RESULTS: The highest-ranked candidate criteria considered absolute changes (Delta) of  the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) or British Isles  Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG), MD-global, P:C ratio, and ESR; flare scores can  be calculated (0.5 x DeltaSLEDAI + 0.45 x DeltaP:C ratio + 0.5 x DeltaMD-global + 0.02 x  DeltaESR), where values of >/=1.04 are reflective of a flare. Similarly, BILAG-based  flare scores (0.4 x DeltaBILAG + 0.65 x DeltaP:C ratio + 0.5 x DeltaMD-global + 0.02 x DeltaESR)  of >/=1.15 were diagnostic of a flare. Flare scores increased with flare severity.  CONCLUSION: Consensus has been reached on preliminary criteria for global flares  in cSLE. Further validation studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the  cSLE flare criteria in research and for clinical care.

T1  - Refractory disease in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 685-92
AB  - There is no definition or guidelines for refractory disease (RD) in Systemic  Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). However, new therapies have been tested mainly in  refractory patients. The concept, like the disease, is complex and implies deeper  knowledge on the disease pathogenesis and patients' subsets. RD is not included  in current activity indices of the disease, what raises the question of how are  we monitoring its response to new drugs. In this paper, we analyse some concepts  considered important for the global definition of RD in SLE and in some specific  organ involvements, excluding lupus nephritis. Management issues will be  addressed also. Finally, we review therapeutic options in particular subsets of  the disease, namely, cutaneous, articular, haematological and neuropsychiatric  lupus. Crucial to the management of a patient suspected to be refractory is an  accurate diagnosis, assuring that the persistent clinical manifestations are  derived primarily from SLE and not from a concomitant or alternative process.  Likewise, certainty about the patient compliance with the therapy prescribed is a  frequent unrecognized problem that erroneously might lead to a classification of  RD. Therapy of RD for SLE, in general and in most particular involvements, is  currently based mainly on the clinician's own experience and judgement, with few  randomized trials effectively addressing the issue. In such a heterogeneous  disease, consideration of approval of drugs for single-organ indications may pave  the way for new therapies. Better biomarkers are needed to add accuracy to the  currently used activity indices in order to monitor RD and consolidate its  definition. Prospective studies directed to RD in the main SLE involvements are  needed to improve our understanding on the management of the disease and foster  the development of targeted new drugs.

SP  - 23
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are now known to display not only adult stem cell  multipotency but also robust anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. After  widespread in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing in several autoimmune disease  models, allogenic MSCs have been successfully applied in patients with severe  treatment-refractory systemic lupus erythematosus. The impressive results of  these uncontrolled phase I and II trials - mostly in patients with non-responding  renal disease - point to the need to perform controlled multicentric trials. In  addition, they suggest that there is much to be learned from the basic and  clinical science of MSCs in order to reap the full potential of these  multifaceted progenitor cells in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

SP  - 674-8
AB  - Treatment of patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) who have active  disease refractory to current therapeutic strategies continues to be a real  challenge. Here, we propose that the classic definition of refractory SLE  patients - failure to achieve adequate response to the standard of care - should  be further refined to incorporate the dimension of adequate drug exposure.  Inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability may induce insufficient exposure to  many drugs used in SLE, leading to both apparent inefficacy of treatments and  inappropriate therapeutic escalation. Among others, we have shown that individual  assessment of exposure to mycophenolic acid, the active metabolite of  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) could be used to determine whether a given patient  received adequate doses of MMF. We have also shown that measuring blood  concentrations of hydroxychloroquine could be used as an efficient way to assess  observance, which is a critical issue since a significant proportion of  refractory SLE patients is likely to have poor observance as the primary source  of treatment failure. Finally, we have underlined the importance of assessing  drug interactions as SLE patients often require, in addition to  immunosuppressants, several other drugs to prevent or treat associated  conditions, which may result in decreased exposure to immunosuppressants.  Considering these data, we believe that refractory SLE patients should not only  be defined as the failure to achieve adequate therapeutic response to the  standard of care, but should also incorporate the dimension of inadequate  pharmacokinetic exposure and include drug blood level, interaction and observance  monitoring.

AB  - Although the survival of patients with lupus nephritis (LN) has improved  considerably in recent years, refractory LN appears in a substantial proportion  of patients and, therefore, treatment of LN remains a real challenge today. We  will use the term "refractory" LN, for those cases with none or partial response  to first-line therapies. In this sense, numerous epidemiological factors,  including racial, socioeconomic, histological and serological parameters, may  influence treatment response and, therefore, may have an impact on the outcome of  renal involvement. Initial conventional therapy will depend somewhat on these  epidemiological factors. If this initial therapy fails, fortunately today we have  alternative therapies that include the multitarget therapy and the use of  biologics. Published evidence about these therapies is presented in this review.  Important terms in the management of LN, such as the definition of complete  response, partial response, sustained response and renal flare as well as the  discrimination of different types of flare, are also discussed here according to  the European consensus statement on the terminology used in the management of  lupus glomerulonephritis.

T1  - Cost-of-illness studies in systemic lupus erythematosus: A systematic review.
SP  - 751-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize the state of knowledge regarding the economic burden of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and to evaluate the quality of cost-of-illness  (COI) studies conducted to date. METHODS: Relevant literature was retrieved from  the PubMed database in April 2010. The evaluation of identified articles was  based on 7 key elements of COI studies derived from previous literature on health  economics. Costs derived from each study were converted into 2008 US dollars  using the Consumer Price Index and the purchasing power parity conversion rate.  RESULTS: A total of 11 articles were included in the evaluation. The average  direct costs per patient-year ranged from $3,735-$14,410. Costs of inpatient care  were found to be the largest component of direct costs in most of the studies.  The employment rate varied from 35.8-55%. The average duration of annual  short-term sick leave ranged from 7.0-64.8 days. The mean annual indirect costs  per patient ranged from $1,093-$14,614, depending on the valuation method.  CONCLUSION: There is a substantial economic burden, in terms of health care  resource utilization, associated with SLE, as well as losses of productivity due  to work capacity impairment. The cost estimates in this review should be used  with caution due to significant discrepancies in methodologies across studies.  Future studies should address several methodologic considerations in order to  measure the true costs related to SLE. Incidence-based COI studies are needed to  evaluate the lifetime costs of SLE.

SP  - 619-25
AB  - BACKGROUND:   In patients with various autoimmune and rheumatic diseases, a  drug-induced lupus-like syndrome (DILS) has been reported with the use of  adalimumab, cerrolizumab pegol, etanercept, and infliximab. OBJECTIVE:   To  review clinical characteristics of patients who develop tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) alpha antagonist-induced lupus-like syndrome (TAILS) and review  implications for further TNF alpha antagonist therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  We  describe a 62-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who developed a pruritic  photo-distributed rash two months after the initiation of etanercept therapy. Her  skin biopsy showed lupus erythematosus, and she had positive serum ANA,  anti-Sjogren's syndrome A (SSA)/Ro, and anti-Sjogren's syndrome B (SSB)/La  antibodies. Her symptoms resolved after discontinuation of the drug, topical and  systemic corticosteroids, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Subsequently, her  rheumatoid arthritis was treated with golimumab for six months without recurrence  of skin lesions. Published reports of individuals who have developed TAILS and  those who have continued treatment with alternative TNF alpha antagonists are  reviewed. RESULTS:   TAILS is most commonly associated with the use of etanercept  and infliximab. It occurs most often in women in the fifth decade of life. Onset  of symptoms ranges from less than one month to more than four years.  Syndrome-associated cutaneous lesions and induction of autoantibodies are common.  There is no definitively established mechanism of pathogenesis. Treatment can  include discontinuation of the drug, corticosteroids, immunosuppressives, and  hydroxychloroquine sulfate. To date, 10 patients with TAILS have continued  therapy with an alternative TNF alpha antagonist without recurrence of lupus  symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Development of a DILS after one TNF alpha antagonist does  not preclude continued treatment with an alternative TNF alpha antagonist.

T1  - Adult outcomes of childhood-onset rheumatic diseases.
SP  - 290-5
AB  - A number of studies published over the past 10 years have examined the long-term  health, functional and quality of life outcomes of adults with childhood-onset  rheumatic diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus  erythematosus, juvenile dermatomyositis and localized scleroderma. As increasing  numbers of patients with these conditions survive into adulthood, understanding  the adult outcomes of these pediatric conditions has become ever-more important.  Identifying modifiable risk factors for poor outcomes is vital to improving care  for these patients. In addition, as these conditions and their treatments can  affect cardiovascular health, bone health and fertility, particular attention  needs to be paid to these outcomes. Preparing patients and their families for a  successful transition from pediatric to adult rheumatology care is an important  first-step in the long-term management strategy for this expanding patient  population.

T1  - Clinicopathological insights into lupus glomerulonephritis in Japanese and 
SP  - 321-330
AB  - Lupus nephritis comprises a spectrum of glomerular, vascular, and  tubulointerstitial lesions, which has significant racial variation in severity  and manifestations. The current classification (ISN/RPS 2003) has been improved  successfully for the categorization of lupus glomerulonephritis (LGN). On the  basis of this classification, 480 Japanese cases revealed the following  distribution: class I 3%, class II 16%, class III 13%, class IV-S 11%, class IV-G  41%, class V 16%, and class VI 1%. Class IV-G with chronicity tended to have the  worst renal outcome. Nephrotic syndrome was a more frequent complication in class  IV-S (50%), class IV-G (72%), and class V (56%), with poor renal and actuarial  outcomes. With regard to therapy, treatment options including glucocorticoids  alone or combined with antimetabolites (azathioprine, mizoribine, mycophenolate  mofetil), calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine A, tacrolimus), or alkylating  agents (intravenous cyclophosphamide injection) improved the outcome of LGN;  however, there is no high-grade clinical evidence from Japan. Further studies are  needed to resolve the clinicopathological problems of LGN, especially IV-S, IV-G,  and pure membranous lupus nephritis in Japanese patients.

T1  - Visceral muscle dysmotility syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus: case report 
SP  - 1701-3
AB  - Intestinal pseudo-obstruction (IPO) is not uncommon in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), and IPO in SLE has an apparent association with  ureterohydronephrosis. However, hepatobiliary dilatation without mechanical  obstruction presenting together with IPO and ureterohydronephrosis is much more  scarce in SLE. Here, we named this rare triad of IPO, ureterohydronephrosis, and  biliary tract dilatation as visceral muscle dysmotility syndrome (VMDS). It  always imitates an acute abdomen and is even life-threatening if treated  incorrectly. To diagnose a VMDS, infections and mechanical obstructions should be  ruled out carefully. Here, we report a 24-year-old Chinese woman with SLE who  presented of VMDS that associated with corticoids tapering induced SLE flare. In  this case, early vigorous immunosuppressive treatment conquered the triad timely  and thus yielded a good outcome.

T1  - Presentation and prognosis of shrinking lung syndrome in systemic lupus 
SP  - 1391-6
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune systemic disease that commonly  affects the respiratory system. Shrinking lung syndrome is a rare respiratory  complication associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Patients present with  dyspnea alone or associated with chest pain and orthopnea, lung volume reduction  with no parenchymal abnormalities and a restrictive ventilatory defect on  pulmonary function tests. The pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of shrinking  lung syndrome remain controversial. This study describes the clinical features,  investigations, and outcome of a series of four patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus and shrinking lung syndrome regularly followed on Rheumatology  Service of the Clinics Hospital of the Federal University of Minas Gerais,  Brazil, with a brief review of literature. It emphasizes that, despite prognosis  of shrinking lung syndrome has been reported as good, it may cause severe  functional pulmonary abnormalities and must be treated promptly and aggressively  in order to, at least, stabilize pulmonary function tests.

SP  - 57-64
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is mainly a disease of fertile women and the  coexistence of pregnancy is by no means a rare event. How SLE and its treatment  affect pregnancy outcomes is still a matter of debate. We performed a  retrospective analysis of 41 SLE patients (55 pregnancies) who were followed at  our university hospital from January 2000 to December 2009. The mean age of  patients was 30.6+/-4.8 years and mean disease duration was 6.6+/-5.3 years. After  exclusion of artificial abortions, live birth rate was 84%. Significantly, more  women with stillbirth pregnancies were complicated with antiphospholipid syndrome  (APS) than women with live birth pregnancies (two of eight stillbirth pregnancies  (25%) versus one of 42 live birth pregnancies (2%); p=0.014) and  hypocomplementemia at conception (four of eight stillbirth pregnancies (50%)  versus six of 42 live birth pregnancies (14%); p=0.021). Compared with nonrenal  pregnancies, renal pregnancies were younger at SLE disease onset, had a lower  positivity of anti-RNP antibody, and were more complicated with pregnancy-induced  hypertension. Past maximum dose of prednisolone, the dose of prednisolone at  conception, and percentage of past steroid pulse therapy were higher in renal  pregnancies. Outcomes of pregnancies were not significantly different both for  mothers and for infants between renal and nonrenal pregnancies. We conclude that  it is necessary to provide SLE mothers with the proper information before  pregnancy. Women with APS or hypocomplementemia should be regarded with  particular attention. Optimal management of mothers and infants requires  collaborative efforts of rheumatologists and obstetricians.

T1  - Pediatric SLE--towards a comprehensive management plan.
SP  - 225-33
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) results from complex abnormalities of the  innate and acquired immune systems. For reasons that are currently not well  understood, the disease course and phenotype associated with SLE, although quite  variable, are generally more severe when the diagnosis is made during childhood.  Active disease, infections, lupus nephritis, and neuropsychiatric SLE  manifestations are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Unlike in  adult-onset SLE, systemic glucocorticoid therapy and immunosuppressive  medications are needed for the treatment of the majority of children and  adolescents with SLE. The complex nature of childhood-onset SLE demands a  comprehensive, multidisciplinary management approach that considers the patients'  growth and development, their educational needs, and the unpredictable course of  SLE and its complications.

SP  - 636-40
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus for the  treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). A systematic review of clinical trials on  tacrolimus in LN was conducted. Seven studies met the review inclusion criteria.  Two studies were case-control studies, and five studies were open-label trials.  One randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that tacrolimus significantly  improved lupus nephritis disease activity index (LNDAI) as compared with a  placebo, but no difference was observed between these two groups in terms of  treatment-related adverse events. The other case-control study compared  tacrolimus with standard protocols of oral cyclophosphamide or azathioprine for  the treatment of membranous LN and found that efficacies were similar. All five  open-label prospective studies concluded that tacrolimus is safe and effective as  an induction and maintenance therapy for LN or for the treatment of LN with  persistent proteinuria that failed to respond to prednisolone and  immunosuppressants. In conclusion, this systematic review shows that tacrolimus  may be effective as an induction and maintenance therapy for LN or as a treatment  for LN with persistent proteinuria despite gold standard treatment. However,  further RCTs are needed to compare tacrolimus with standard regimens for the  treatment of LN.

SP  - 3273-80
AB  - Cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis. This is currently a very active area of  research. Of particular interest is the use of cytokines as biomarkers of disease  activity in SLE and lupus nephritis. Can cytokine measurements assist in early  detection of renal flare in known lupus nephritis? Can such measurements be used  to distinguish between flare and chronic damage? Or help to confirm renal  remission? Could they be used to help assess the required duration of  immunosuppression and reduce the need for invasive renal biopsy? This review  discusses limitations of current laboratory methods in monitoring SLE, how  measurements of cytokines may contribute in relation to following disease  activity and summarizes what is known about cytokines as biomarkers in SLE and  lupus nephritis.

SP  - i64-i66
AB  - PURPOSE: The author's goal is to review recent phase III clinical trials in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with emphasis on outcomes and  on mechanisms by which the experimental drugs/biological agents suppress  autoimmunity. METHODS: Prospective, randomised, controlled clinical trials in SLE  published in the past 3 years identified in a PubMed search were reviewed, as  well as abstracts describing similar but currently unpublished clinical trials  presented at international meetings 2008-10. CONCLUSIONS: Two interventions have  been proved in large multicentre prospective trials to be useful in the  management of SLE: mycophenolate mofetil (equivalent to cyclophosphamide with a  similar safety profile) and anti-BLyS (Benlysta), which was superior to placebo  when added to background immunosuppression and did not appear to increase  toxicity. The anti-BLyS trial outcome measure was an anchored composite index  that required reduction of disease activity measure by the systemic lupus  erythematosus disease activity index. Other trials that failed or the results of  which are pending are also discussed.

SP  - 246-58
AB  - PURPOSE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare response  rates (complete remission plus partial remission) for nonsteroid  immunosuppressant therapy to steroid-only immunosuppressant therapy in patients  with membranous lupus nephritis. METHODS: A literature review was conducted from  June 25, 2010 by querying PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases. Inclusion  criteria were trials containing remission data on patients with confirmed pure  class V (Va and Vb) membranous lupus nephritis. The primary analysis evaluates  response rates for regimens that contain at least one nonsteroid  immunosuppressant therapy and steroid-only immunosuppressant therapy. A  proportion meta-analysis using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model was  performed. Data are reported as pooled proportions in percentages with 95%  confidence intervals. Significant heterogeneity and/or bias were compensated for  by trial exclusion. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria for  meta-analysis, which yielded 34 groups of patients' data. Upon meta-analysis, the  response rate for nonsteroid immunosuppressant therapy is higher than for  steroids alone (81% [74%-87%] vs 60% [39%-79%]), even when compensating for  significant heterogeneity and bias (76% [71%-81%] versus 60% [39%-79%]).  CONCLUSION: Nonsteroid immunosuppressant therapies in combination with steroids  seem to be more effective than steroids alone for inducing partial or complete  remission in patients with membranous lupus nephritis who have nephrotic  proteinuria at baseline. This trial was not able to analyze adverse events,  flares, relapses, or patient survival because of underreporting.

T1  - Type I interferon in organ-targeted autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
SP  - S5
AB  - A significant role for IFNalpha in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus  is well supported, and clinical trials of anti-IFNalpha monoclonal antibodies are in  progress in this disease. In other autoimmune diseases characterized by  substantial inflammation and tissue destruction, the role of type I interferons  is less clear. Gene expression analysis of peripheral blood cells from patients  with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis demonstrate an interferon  signature similar to but less intense than that seen in patients with lupus. In  both of those diseases, presence of the interferon signature has been associated  with more significant clinical manifestations. At the same time, evidence  supports an anti-inflammatory and beneficial role of IFNbeta locally in the joints  of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in murine arthritis models, and many  patients with multiple sclerosis show a clinical response to recombinant IFNbeta. As  can also be proposed for type I diabetes mellitus, type I interferon appears to  contribute to the development of autoimmunity and disease progression in multiple  autoimmune diseases, while maintaining some capacity to control established  disease - particularly at local sites of inflammation. Recent studies in both  rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis suggest that quantification of type I  interferon activity or target gene expression might be informative in predicting  responses to distinct classes of therapeutic agents.

AB  - The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is common among patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially those with active disease who  often have poorer quality of life and significant unmet needs. It is important  for the rheumatologist to be aware of these therapies and to ask the patient with  SLE about their active use or future interest in CAM. Future studies on the  effectiveness of the aforementioned therapies will be crucial to find better ways  for the rheumatologist to integrate their use into the care of the patient with  SLE.

SP  - 175-82
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by  abnormalities in the activity of B-cells and T-cells. A novel specific treatment  for autoimmune diseases is B-cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies.  Epratuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD22 antigen on B-cells.  Initial phase II and two terminated early phase III studies suggest that  treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus with this immunomodulatory agent is  effective, well tolerated and significantly improves the patient's quality of  life. In vitro studies and clinical trials with non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients  indicate epratuzumab can potentially serve as a complementary drug in combination  therapy with another inhibitor of B-cell activity, rituximab, which is a  monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody.

SP  - 824-9
AB  - Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare but frequently fatal  complication of SLE. It occurs in the context of both active and inactive lupus  and carries a worse overall prognosis than idiopathic acquired TTP. Recent  advances in the knowledge and treatment of TTP do not seem to have brought  similar improvements in the management and outcome of TTP in SLE. The  illumination of the role of the von Willebrand factor multimer protease, ADAMTS13  in idiopathic TTP continues to enhance our comprehension of the pathogenesis of  the disease and has contributed to improvements in diagnosis and management. We  explore the overlap of TTP and SLE, and discuss the current understanding of the  involvement of ADAMTS13 and its implications for patients with this uncommon form  of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that afflicts  500,000 people in the United States. There has not been a new SLE drug approved  in the United States since 1958. However, a guidance document issued by the Food  and Drug Administration in 2005 provided a roadmap for investigators which  spawned numerous ongoing clinical trials. Among these, Belimumab, a monoclonal  antibody to soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, met its primary endpoints in two  large trials and will probably obtain FDA approval soon. Other promising agents  targeting a variety of mechanisms of action are currently in development. This  minireview highlights the latest therapies under investigation in SLE and gives  an overview of the pathways that are specifically being targeted.

SP  - 23-34
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are chronic  autoimmune diseases associated with confirmed high risk of cardiovascular  pathology. Most low-risk patients develop cardiovascular complications (CVC) with  the involvement of traditional factors of limited diagnostic value which requires  introduction of new efficacious methods for CVC prognostication. Reduced cardiac  rhythm variability (CRV) along with increased levels of inflammation markers is  an independent predictor of unfavourable outcome in patients with coronary heart  disease, chronic cardiac insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension,  and metabolic syndrome; it may be a consequence of joint contribution of sympatic  activation and inflammation to the development of atherothrombotic complications.  This review is focused on the methods of CRV evaluation, possible mechanisms of  mutual potentiation of autonomous nervous system disturbances and inflammatory  process, factors responsible for cardiac autonomous dysfunction in RA and SLE.  Much attention is given to the possibilities of correction of vegetative  dysregulation of cardiac activity in patients with autoimmune diseases.

SP  - S156-9
AB  - While there is still no convincing evidence that methotrexate is of benefit in  primary Sjogren's syndrome, the SLE evidence on this rheumatology anchor drug is  substantial. In fact, there are randomised controlled trials showing the benefit  for methotrexate on overall SLE activity, reduction in glucocorticoid doses, and  effects on lupus arthritis and lupus skin manifestations. In addition,  methotrexate may be helpful in vasculitis, haematological manifestations, and  perhaps kidney disease. Intrathecal methotrexate was successfully used in  neuropsychiatric SLE. Taken together, using methotrexate in SLE is not only a  common approach, but, at least in part, supported by evidence from clinical  trials.

T1  - Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in autoimmune diseases.
SP  - 699-715
AB  - The term 'autoimmune diseases' encompasses a spectrum of diseases whose clinical  manifestations and, possibly, biological features vary widely. The results of  conventional treatment are considered unsatisfactory in aggressive forms, with  subsets of patients having short life expectancies. Relying on wide experimental  evidence and more feeble clinical data, some research groups have used autologous  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the most disabling autoimmune  diseases with the aim of resetting the patient's immune system. Immunoablative  conditioning regimens are preferred over their myeloablative counterparts, and  some form of in vivo and/or ex vivo T-cell depletion is generally adopted.  Despite 15 years' experience, published controlled clinical trials are still  lacking, with the evidence so far available coming from pilot studies and  registry surveys. In multiple sclerosis, clinical improvement, or at least  lasting disease stabilization, can be achieved in the majority of the patients;  nevertheless, the worst results are observed in patients with progressive  disease, where no benefit can be expected from conventional therapy. Concerning  rheumatologic diseases, wide experience has been acquired in systemic sclerosis,  with long-term improvements in cutaneous disease being frequently reported,  although visceral involvement remains unchanged at best. Autografting has proved  to be barely effective in rheumatoid arthritis and quite toxic in juvenile  idiopathic arthritis, whereas it leads to clinical remission and the reversal of  visceral impairment in the majority of patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus. A promising indication is Crohn's disease, in which long-term  endoscopic remission is frequently observed. Growing experience with autologous  HCST in autoimmune diseases has progressively reduced concerns about  transplant-related mortality and secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia. Therefore, a  sustained complete remission seems to be within the reach of autografting in some  autoimmune diseases; in others, the indications, risks and benefits of  autografting need to be better defined. Consequently, the search for new drugs  should also be encouraged.

Establishing strict inclusion and exclusion  criteria, we performed an extensive search for studies in MEDLINE and BIREME  databases to assess the studies that evaluated the frequency of HPV infection,  pre-cancerous cervical abnormalities, and cervical cancer in women with SLE.  Secondary references were additionally obtained from the included articles.  Thirty-three articles met the criteria previously established. Fifteen out of 18  studies that performed cytological analysis showed a higher frequency of squamous  intraepithelial lesions in SLE patients compared with normal women. Moreover,  three studies found a higher frequency of high-grade squamous intraepithelial  lesions. Additionally, it was observed that women with SLE had a higher frequency  of HPV infection, confirmed by molecular biology techniques. Curiously, despite  the above findings, no increased frequency of cervical cancer was observed in the  majority of the studies which addressed this issue. Five studies observed a  relationship between cervical abnormalities and previous use of immunosuppressive  drugs. This review suggests that SLE patients seem not to be at increased risk  for developing cervical cancer; however, they should be considered at higher risk  for HPV infection and cervical dysplasia than the general population. Thus,  gynecological visits at shorter intervals seem to be a reasonable approach for  those patients.

T1  - Updates on the treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 2028-35
AB  - The treatment of lupus nephritis has changed significantly over the past decade  in large part because of data from well-conducted randomized clinical trials. The  concept of two phases of therapy-induction and maintenance-is widely accepted.  The histopathologic classification of lupus nephritis continues to guide therapy,  and treatment for all major classes of lupus nephritis has seen some shift in  management during this time. New regimens using lower doses and shorter treatment  durations of intravenous cyclophosphamide have been advanced to reduce toxicity  without sacrificing efficacy of therapy. Mycophenolate mofetil has emerged as a  viable alternative to cyclophosphamide for induction therapy of both  proliferative and membranous lupus nephritis. Combination induction treatment  with multiple agents has also been successful. Large controlled trials using  mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine for maintenance therapy have been  performed. Here, we review recent additions to the growing body of literature on  how to most effectively treat lupus nephritis with the least amount of toxicity.  We discuss new treatment strategies currently being explored in clinical trials.

T1  - Vitamin D in lupus 
SP  - 218-22
AB  - Vitamin D is an essential steroid hormone, with well established effects on  mineral metabolism, skeletal health, and recently established effects on the  cardiovascular and immune systems. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and  evidence is mounting that it contributes to the morbidity and mortality of  multiple chronic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients  with SLE avoid the sun because of photosensitive rashes and potential for disease  fare, so adequate oral supplementation is critical. This review will describe the  prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with SLE, identify risk factors  for deficiency, describe the consequences of deficiency, and review current  vitamin D recommendations for patients with rheumatic diseases.

SP  - 175-8
AB  - The pace of clinical trials activity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  continues to accelerate. After decades of reliance on largely empiric approaches,  a solid evidence-based foundation to guide our use of traditional agents, such as  cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, is finally developing. In addition, we are  learning how to integrate relatively new immunosuppressive agents, such as  mycophenolate mofetil, into the treatment of SLE. These advances provide an  important backdrop for recent trials designed to determine the potential value of  several promising biologic therapies for SLE.

T1  - Rheumatic diseases and pregnancy.
SP  - 458-65
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses how inflammatory rheumatic diseases  [rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE)] of the mother can influence the course of pregnancy and the development of  the fetus. Antirheumatic drug therapy of the mother and strategies to prevent  fetal complications namely in SLE must be considered with care. RECENT FINDINGS:  The current literature is presented discussing hypotheses about the immunologic  mechanisms leading to amelioration or exacerbation of the rheumatic symptoms in  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis during pregnancy. In SLE, several  recent studies have been published concerning fetal complications in the  antiphospholipid syndrome and in Ro/SSA-positive and La/SSB-positive mothers and  how to diagnose, treat, or prevent these. SUMMARY: Today, women with inflammatory  rheumatic diseases are normally fertile and can be encouraged to become pregnant,  when there is a stable and quiescent phase of the disease. This is in particular  important for patients with SLE, although pregnancy outcome in SLE has improved  over the last decades. Pregnancy in SLE is still a high-risk period during the  disease course with the highest risk in women with active lupus nephritis. In  contrast, women with rheumatoid arthritis develop amelioration of the rheumatic  symptoms during the course of pregnancy in most cases; female ankylosing  spondylitis patients are likely to show unaltered or aggravated symptoms of back  pain and impaired function.

T1  - Mycophenolate mofetil for induction treatment of lupus nephritis: a systematic 
SP  - 69-78
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to systematically review the efficacy and safety of mycophenolic acid  and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) compared to cyclophosphamide (CYC) for the  induction treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: medline, Embase, the  Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials, and abstracts presented in major  international conferences were searched for randomized controlled trials. The  primary outcome was renal remission (complete, partial, and overall) and  secondary outcomes were adverse events during study period and longterm followup  data. Data were compared between groups and relative risk (RR) and 95% CI were  calculated. RESULTS: four trials of a total of 618 patients were included. MMF  was not superior to CYC for renal remission (partial RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to  1.12; complete RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.28, and overall RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to  1.10). There was a significant reduction in alopecia (RR 5.77, 95% CI 1.56 to  21.38) and amenorrhea (RR 6.64, 95% CI 2.00 to 22.07) with the use of MMF  compared to CYC. These results should be interpreted with caution given the width  of the CI. There was no significant difference for infections, leukopenia,  gastrointestinal symptoms, herpes zoster, endstage renal disease, and death among  groups during study period and longterm followup data. CONCLUSION: we could not  show that MMF is superior to CYC for the induction treatment of LN. Patients  treated with MMF showed reduced risk of certain side effects. MMF can be used as  an alternative to CYC for the induction treatment of LN.

T1  - Acute transverse myelitis and antiphospholipid antibodies in lupus. No evidence 
SP  - 556-63
AB  - Current views suggest that prothrombotic properties of antiphospholipid  antibodies (aPL) have a role in the development of acute transverse myelitis  (ATM) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Consequently, empiric  anticoagulation may be included in these patients' treatment. We performed a  systemic review of the literature to explore the clinical value of the presence  of aPL in patients with lupus myelitis and the possible effectiveness of  anticoagulation. We analyzed clinical and laboratory data extracted from  published cases of SLE-associated ATM, fulfilling the Transverse Myelitis  Consortium Working Group diagnostic criteria, that provided information on aPL.  We report on a total of 70 patients. aPL, detected upon ATM onset in 54% of  patients, neither predicted the involvement of the thoracic part of the spine,  which has been postulated to reflect a predominantly thrombosis-induced injury,  nor correlated with relapsing ATM, additional lupus CNS manifestations, or worse  clinical outcome. An unfavorable outcome could be predicted by paralysis (P=0.02)  and abnormal CSF findings at presentation (P=0.02). Whilst all patients received  major immunosuppressive regimens, severe neurologic impairment (estimated  Expanded Disability Status Scale score>7) was found primarily in aPL-negative  patients (P=0.03). Anticoagulation was more frequently applied in aPL-positive  patients (P=0.04), but any additional therapeutic effect was not evident.  Detection of circulating aPL at ATM onset appears unreliable to suggest a  thrombotic cause and perhaps not enough to dictate therapeutic anticoagulation.  Registry creation of ATM in patients with SLE is needed to obtain more definite  answers on the role of aPL in this condition.

T1  - Therapeutic opportunities in systemic lupus erythematosus: state of the art and 
SP  - 1603-11
AB  - Immune responses against endogenous nuclear antigens are characteristic of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a highly pleiomorphic disease predominantly  affecting young women of reproductive age. Genome-wide association studies have  confirmed the importance of genes associated with the immune response as well as  genes involved in endothelial function and tissue response to injury. Immune  complexes, autoantibodies, complement, cytokines, endothelial injury and a  thrombophilic state associated with antiphospholipid antibodies are important for  mediating tissue dysfunction. If not treated promptly, a significant proportion  of patients-especially those with more aggressive disease-accumulate irreversible  damage. During the past decade, novel combinations of immunosuppressive drugs and  biologicals have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium. At the same time,  the emphasis in the management of lupus has shifted from individual drugs to a  strategy that aims at early, sustained remission tailored to disease  manifestations and severity with the lowest possible toxicity. Infections and  accelerated atherosclerosis (attributed to both traditional and non-traditional  risk factors) and thrombosis-related clinical events (including arterial, venous  and pregnancy loss) represent a major challenge in the management of the disease.  To avoid fragmentation and optimise medical care, evidence and expert-based  recommendations have been developed. For the future the authors predict a new  taxonomy on the basis of mechanisms rather than clinical empiricism, leading to  targeted therapy.

SP  - 2060-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Studies of the impact of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) and its pregnancy complications have yielded conflicting results. Major  limitations of these studies relate to their small numbers of patients and  retrospective designs. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic  literature review of pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE and a meta-analysis of  the association of lupus nephritis with adverse pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN,  SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We searched electronic databases from 1980  to 2009 and reviewed papers with validity criteria. Random-effects analytical  methods were used to evaluate pregnancy complications rates. RESULTS:  Thirty-seven studies with 1842 patients and 2751 pregnancies were included.  Maternal complications included lupus flare (25.6%), hypertension (16.3%),  nephritis (16.1%), pre-eclampsia (7.6%), and eclampsia (0.8%). The induced  abortion rate was 5.9%, and when excluded, fetal complications included  spontaneous abortion (16.0%), stillbirth (3.6%), neonatal deaths (2.5%), and  intrauterine growth retardation (12.7%). The unsuccessful pregnancy rate was  23.4%, and the premature birth rate was 39.4%. Meta-regression analysis showed  statistically significant positive associations between premature birth rate and  active nephritis and increased hypertension rates in subjects with active  nephritis or a history of nephritis. History of nephritis was also associated  with pre-eclampsia. Anti-phospholipid antibodies were associated with  hypertension, premature birth, and an increased rate of induced abortion.  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with SLE, both lupus nephritis and anti-phospholipid  antibodies increase the risks for maternal hypertension and premature births. The  presented evidence further supports timing of pregnancy relative to SLE activity  and multispecialty care of these patients.

T1  - Prevalence and burden of pediatric-onset systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 538-46
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease  with a highly variable clinical course. Pediatric-onset SLE (pSLE) represents  10-20% of all SLE cases, and is associated with higher disease severity,  including more-rapid damage accrual, than adult-onset SLE. As in adults, pSLE  disease expression varies according to ethnicity, with a milder disease course in  white patients. The majority of pSLE patients will have developed damage within  5-10 years of disease onset, most frequently involving the musculoskeletal,  ocular, renal and neuropsychiatric systems. Owing to improvements in disease  management and recognition over the past 20-30 years, patients now live longer,  but as a result have increased disease damage. Premature atherosclerosis and  osteoporosis have become increasingly prevalent morbidities in pSLE patients.  Early atherosclerosis leads to a considerable rise in cardiovascular and  cerebrovascular events, and failure to develop adequate peak bone mass during  adolescence-a crucial period of bone accrual-is likely to lead to early  osteoporosis and fractures. Patients with pSLE have an incurable, potentially  devastating disease that occurs during a vulnerable period of psychosocial  development, leading to specific and unique psychosocial stressors. Additional  large, long-term follow-up studies in pSLE are needed to better understand the  disease prognosis and to facilitate development of tailored treatments.

SP  - 686480
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex systemic autoimmune disease with  involvement of both B cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes and several cytokines  aberrations. Standard therapy for SLE has its limitations. Tacrolimus, a novel  calcineurin inhibitor with potent immunosuppressive effects, has been shown in  the recent years to be effective in SLE therapy. This paper serves to collate the  experimental and clinical data on the efficacy of tacrolimus in the treatment of  SLE and lupus nephritis. Tacrolimus as a key component of multitarget therapy in  SLE is also discussed. The immunocytokine modulatory effects of tacrolimus are  also reviewed with reference to SLE. It can be concluded that tacrolimus has an  established role in the management of SLE.

T1  - Efficacy and adverse events of mycophenolate mofetil versus cyclophosphamide for 
SP  - 227-235
AB  - We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled  trials to compare complete remission and adverse events (that is, infection,  leukopenia, and gastrointestinal [GI] symptoms) between mycophenolate mofetil  (MMF) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). We  identified trials from MEDLINE using the PubMed and Ovid search engines, and from  The Cochrane Central Register of Randomized Controlled Trials. Eligible studies  were randomized controlled trials comparing MMF with CYC with 1 of following  outcomes: complete remission, complete/partial remission, infection, leukopenia,  GI symptoms, serum creatinine, 24-hour urine protein, and urine albumin. Data  were independently extracted by 2 reviewers. Five trials with a total of 638  patients were eligible for review. While the MMF group tended to achieve complete  remission more frequently than the CYC group, this was not significant (pooled  risk ratio [RR], 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-2.93). Pooling based on  the 4 homogeneous trials yielded similar results-that is, no benefit of MMF  compared with CYC groups (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.74-1.77). The complete or partial  remission rates were also not different (pooled RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.97-1.48)  among the groups. The adverse events (infection, renal function, and GI symptoms)  were not significantly different, except for leukopenia, which was lower in the  MMF group. In summary, patients treated with MMF and CYC had similar remission  rates, but the MMF group had less frequent leukopenia than the CYC group. Further  large-scale trials are needed to confirm these results.

T1  - Gastrointestinal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus: insight into 
SP  - 2971-7
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease  characterized by the presence of a plethora of autoantibodies and immune complex  formation. Virtually every system and organ can be affected by SLE.  Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in SLE patients, and more than half of them  are caused by adverse reactions to medications and viral or bacterial infections.  Though not as common as lupus nephritis, SLE-related gastrointestinal involvement  is clinically important because most cases can be life-threatening if not treated  promptly. Lupus mesenteric vasculitis is the most common cause, followed by  protein-losing enteropathy, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, acute pancreatitis and  other rare complications such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel diseases,  etc. No specific autoantibody is identified as being associated with SLE-related  gastroenteropathy. Imaging studies, particularly abdominal computed tomography  scans, are helpful in diagnosing some SLE-related gastroenteropathies. Most of  these complications have good therapeutic responses to corticosteroids and  immunosuppressive agents. Supportive measures such as bowel rest, nutritional  support, antibiotics and prokinetic medications are helpful in facilitating  functional recovery and improving the outcome.

SP  - 298-306
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review and summarize published information on the use,  effectiveness, and adverse effects of danazol in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A MEDLINE search from January 1950 to July 2009 was  conducted using 2 search strategies retrieving 51 and 62 references,  respectively. We also searched 2 standard reference textbooks and bibliographies  of the 38 articles selected. RESULTS: Of the 38 articles selected, there were 19  case series/reports with a total of 153 patients, including 2 prospective trials  of 7 and 16 patients, respectively, and 1 randomized controlled trial of 40  patients. Danazol has been used successfully in the treatment of hematologic  manifestations of SLE such as thrombocytopenia, Evan's syndrome, autoimmune  hemolytic anemia, and a case of red cell aplasia. Thirteen patients responded to  danazol after failing splenectomy. There is limited information on the use of  danazol in nonhematologic manifestations of SLE. Adverse effects were generally  tolerable but high doses may produce undesirable side effects for female  patients. CONCLUSIONS: Danazol is a useful drug in the treatment of SLE patients,  especially in patients with refractory thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic  anemia, and premenstrual flares, and in some mild nonhematologic manifestations  of SLE. It appears to be relatively well tolerated, safe, and efficacious.

AB  - We present two patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO; Devic's syndrome), one  associated with systemic lupus erythematosus and the other with Hashimoto  thyroiditis. Devic's syndrome, whose initial symptoms and signs mimic those of  multiple sclerosis, can be associated with other autoimmune diseases. We  emphasize the importance of ruling out other entities throughout the follow-up.  NMO is seldom described in patients with lupus, which may be due to the rare  occurrence of this association sometimes leading to its misdiagnosis.

T1  - Managing contraception and pregnancy in the rheumatologic diseases.
SP  - 373-85
AB  - Most pregnancies in women with rheumatologic disease will result in the delivery  of a healthy baby. Pregnancy can be particularly risky in women with active  disease or on teratogenic medications, making contraception an important issue  for these women. All women with rheumatologic disease have contraceptive options,  including barrier methods, the intra-uterine device and progesterone-only  medications. Active inflammatory disease, whether in the form of lupus, systemic  vasculitis or myositis, places the pregnancy at increased risk. Pre-eclampsia is  a particular risk for women with lupus or antiphospholipid syndrome and may be  decreased by daily low-dose aspirin. Rheumatoid arthritis typically improves and  does not have a major impact on pregnancy outcomes. The expected post-partum  arthritis flare may be avoided by restarting medications soon after delivery.  Judicious use of medication and close observation may be the keys to successful  pregnancy in women with rheumatologic disease.

T1  - [Lupus-nephritis--diagnosis and treatment].
SP  - 1140-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune, multiorgan  disease that usually affects young women. The kidneys are affected (lupus  nephritis) in close to one fifth of the patients. Over the past decade earlier  diagnosis and improved treatment of lupus nephritis has resulted in substantial  improvement of renal function and patient survival. Despite these advances, 10 -  15 % of SLE patients with lupus nephritis progress to end-stage renal disease,  requiring dialysis or renal transplantation. The article outlines main principles  for diagnosing and treating lupus nephritis, according to current practice at  Oslo University Hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: National and international  guidelines (on treatment of lupus nephritis), literature identified through a  non-systematic search in PubMed and our own clinical experience form the basis  for the article. RESULTS: In lupus nephritis, low-dose cyclophosphamide and  corticosteroids are topical treatment for induction therapy, and mycophenolate  mofetil is an alternative treatment. We recommend maintenance treatment with  azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil for at least two years. Treatment with  rituximab may be considered in patients with refractory lupus nephritis.  INTERPRETATION: Subtypes and activity of the renal disease are decisive for  choice of treatment.

T1  - Biologics in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 504-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  involves aberrancy in multiple components of the immune system including B cells,  T cells, cytokines and growth factors. Therapeutic agents targeting these  mediators selectively have been tested for the treatment of SLE. This review  summarizes the recent advances in the fast expanding field of these biological  therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: The two large phase 2/3 randomized placebo-controlled  trials of B-cell depletion, using anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, in SLE, reported  unexpected negative results. On the contrary, two large phase 3 trials of  belimumab, the monoclonal antibody against B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), showed  significant clinical benefit. Response rates were 57.6 and 43.2% for 10 mg/kg  belimumab, compared with 43.6 and 33.8% for placebo in BLISS-52 and BLISS-76,  respectively. Studies of a co-stimulation blocker (abatacept), tumor necrosis  factor inhibitor (infliximab), and interleukin-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab) were  either negative (abatacept) or were associated with high rates of adverse events.  Studies of T cell and interferon inhibition remain in the early development  phase. SUMMARY: Despite the enthusiasm in the field of biologic therapies, the  majority of these new modalities have fallen short of expectations for various  reasons. Only belimumab has recently met its primary outcome in two phase 3  trials.

SP  - 237-49
AB  - Although the survival rate for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has improved  dramatically during the past 50 years, the quality of life of patients afflicted  with this disease remains poor. Currently existent measures of disease activity  and damage in SLE do not capture the patient's perspective and health-related  quality of life (HRQoL). Most studies in SLE pertaining to HRQoL are from  developed Western societies, with only a few from others. These studies have been  conducted predominantly in women and using the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form  36, a generic HRQoL instrument that has been shown not to be sensitive to change  in lupus. Existent lupus-specific HRQoL measures have not yet been used in SLE  clinical trials. New HRQoL research tools are currently undergoing validation in  different countries, languages, and cultural settings, which may help dissect the  underlying role of socioeconomic status and specific disease-related features  that impact SLE-related quality of life.

RESULTS: 212 patients were SSA positive and 131 were  both SSA and SSB positive. During follow-up, SSA antibodies disappear in 8  patients; 2 of them exhibit new systemic complications of pSS. 68 patients had  cryoglobulinemia. 52 patients had other anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)  specificities: anti-RNP (n=12), anti-centromere (n=14), anti-DNA native (n=19),  anti-Scl70 (n=3), anti-JO1 (n=3), anti-Sm (n=3) and anti-histone (n=1). Fourteen  patients developed ANA-associated auto-immune disease during the follow-up: 5  polymyositis (mean apparition delay 78months), 6 systemic lupus erythematosus  (mean occurrence delay 77months) and 2 systemic sclerosis (mean occurrence delay  133+/-64months). Among these 14 patients, only three presented atypical-ANA at  pSS diagnosis. Cryoglobulinemia and anti-SSA and SSB antibodies at diagnosis were  associated with new systemic involvements. IN CONCLUSION: Cryoglobulinemia and  SSA/SSB positivity are associated with systemic activity after diagnosis in pSS.  Although atypical ANA are found in 12% of the cases, long-term evolution to ANA  associated auto-immune diseases concerned patients with active immunological  profile and extra-glandular manifestations.

SP  - 608-10
AB  - Hypoparathyroidism is rare in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Here we describe a case of SLE coexisted with hypoparathyroidism and ankylosing  spondylitis with definite diagnosis, and also give a review of past five cases of  SLE with hypoparathyroidism. We find that hypoparathyroidism is easily ignored by  subtle manifestations despite of its significant complications. More attention  should be paid to clues to hypocalcemia, symptoms of central nervous system and  prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram. The three diseases may be coexistent  of genetically determined markers. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in SLE patient  is not clear. It may be independent of SLE.

T1  - Pitfalls and opportunities in measuring patient outcomes in lupus.
SP  - 229-36
AB  - Health outcomes and their measures used as end points in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) patient care and clinical trials have been varied and are  still evolving. Although significant reductions in morbidity and mortality in SLE  have been achieved, the medications approved for SLE have remained the same  during the past 50 years. Despite the pressing need, aggressive advocacy in the  community, and advances in drug development and testing in SLE, no medications  have met US Food and Drug Administration guidelines for a new indication claim  approval for SLE. This may be attributable to its multisystemic, remitting, and  relapsing nature, and difficulty in identifying useful end points and appropriate  tools to measure them. Thus, it is pivotal to identify and validate appropriate  global, disease-specific, and perhaps organ-specific health outcomes for clinical  research. This article reviews recent physician- and patient-generated health  outcomes in SLE.

T1  - Use of type I interferon-inducible mRNAs as pharmacodynamic markers and potential 
SP  - S6
AB  - Type I interferons are implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). Type I interferon-inducible mRNAs are widely and  concordantly overexpressed in the periphery and involved tissues of a subset of  SLE patients, and provide utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers to aid dose  selection, as well as potential indicators of patients who might respond  favorably to anti-IFNalpha therapy in SLE. We implemented a three-tiered approach to  identify a panel of type I interferon-inducible mRNAs to be used as potential  pharmacodynamic biomarkers to aid dose selection in clinical trials of  sifalimumab, an anti-IFNalpha monoclonal antibody under development for the treatment  of SLE. In a single-dose escalation phase 1 trial, we observed a  sifalimumab-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of the overexpression of type  I interferon-inducible mRNAs in the blood of treated subjects. Inhibition of  expression of type I interferon-inducible mRNAs and proteins was also observed in  skin lesions of SLE subjects from the same trial. Inhibiting IFNalpha resulted in a  profound downstream effect in these SLE subjects that included suppression of  mRNAs of B-cell activating factor belonging to the TNF family and the signaling  pathways of TNFalpha, IL-10, IL-1beta, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating  factor in both the periphery and skin lesions. A scoring method based on the  expression of type I interferon-inducible mRNAs partitioned SLE patients into two  distinct subpopulations, which suggests the possibility of using these type I  interferon-inducible genes as predictive biomarkers to identify SLE patients who  might respond more favorably to anti-type I interferon therapy.

T1  - [Endothelial dysfunction in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 70-4
AB  - It is currently shown that endothelial function study is a rather informative way  of assessing the cardiovascular risk. Many investigations have shown the high  rate of endothelial dysfunction (ED) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE);  however, clinical data on ED in patients with SLE are scarce; which seems to be  generated by difficulties in the diagnosis of this condition and to necessitate  the modification of the existing diagnostic methods. The signs of ED were  detected in 40% of the patients. Its development was associated with the activity  of SLE, the presence of Raynaud's syndrome, elevated systolic blood pressure,  plasma fibrinogen levels, and the larger daily dose ofprednisolone. The method  proposed by the authors to study endothelialfunction from the diagnostic  capacities on the basis of volumetric compression oscillometry is comparable with  the standard ultrasound method, which allows its clinical use to evaluate the  endothelial state.

T1  - The immunological basis of B-cell therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 3-11
AB  - Loss of B-cell tolerance is a hallmark feature of the pathogenesis in systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that is characterized by  hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production. These autoantibodies lead to  formation of immune-complex deposition in internal organs causing inflammation  and damage. Autoreactive B-cells are believed to be central in the  pathophysiology of SLE. Other than its role in the production of antibodies that  mediate humoral immune response, B-cells also function as antigen-presenting  cells and are capable of activating T-cells. Activated B-cells may also produce  pro-inflammatory cytokines that aggravate local inflammation. Abnormal B-cell  homeostasis has been described in SLE patients. This may occur as a result of  intrinsic B-cell defect or from aberrant regulation by maturation and survival  signals. B-cell-based therapy is the current mainstream of research and  development of novel therapies in SLE patients with severe and refractory  disease. Potential cellular and molecular targets for B-cell therapies include  cell surface molecules such as CD20 (rituximab) and CD22 (epratuzumab);  co-stimulatory molecules involved in B-cell-T-cell interaction such as CTLA4 and  B7 molecules (abatacept); maturation and growth factors such as B-cell activating  factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand (belimumab, briobacept, atacicept) and  B-cell tolerogen (abetimus). This article provides an overview on normal B-cell  physiology and abnormal B-cell biology in SLE that form the immunological basis  of B-cell-targeted therapy in the treatment of these patients with refractory  diseases.

T1  - Monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins and their complications: targeting B 
SP  - 814-20
AB  - The immune system consists of a complex array of immunocompetent cells and  inflammatory mediators that exist in complex networks. These components interact  through cascades and feedback circuits, maintaining physiologic inflammation and  immunosurveillance. In various autoimmune conditions, a foreign or auto-antigen  may upset this fine balance, leading to dysregulated immunity, persistent  inflammation, and ultimately pathologic sequelae. In recent years, there has been  tremendous progress delineating the specific components of the immune system that  contribute to normal immunity and specific disease states. With this greater  understanding of pathogenesis coupled with advances in biotechnology, many  immunomodulatory agents, commonly called biologic agents, have been introduced.  The 2 most common classes of biologic agents are monoclonal antibodies and fusion  proteins. These agents can inhibit targets with exquisite specificity to optimize  outcomes and minimize toxicity. B cells contribute significantly to the  initiation and perpetuation of the immune responses. B cells not only can produce  potentially pathologic autoantibodies and proinflammatory cytokines but also can  present antigens to T cells and provide costimulatory signals essential for  T-cell activation, clonal expansion, and effector function. This review focuses  on biologic agents targeting B cells in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and  systemic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - [Telomeres and telomerase: relevance and future prospects in systemic lupus 
SP  - 345-52
AB  - Telomeres are specialized structures that cap and protect the end of chromosomes.  Telomeres progressively shorten after each cellular division unless an enzyme,  the telomerase, counteracts. Telomeres are implicated in cellular senescence,  acting like a biological clock. Telomere length and telomerase activity are  important in the physiopathology of cancer. In the past years, research has  focused on them in order to find new therapeutic targets. Yet, oxidative stress,  inflammation and increased leucocytes renewal are major environmental factors  associated with telomeres shortening acceleration and thus in concordance with  biological age. Thus, telomeric erosion induces cell apoptosis; indeed, apoptotic  cell clearance is impaired in systemic lupus. Considering these elements and data  resulting from oncology, telomere/telomerase couple was studied during the last  decade in systemic lupus erythematosus. The objective was to know if this couple  could have an implication in the physiopathology of this disease. A systematic  review of literature is proposed about telomere and/or telomerase in systemic  lupus erythematosus in order to discuss their physiopathological implication.  Among 273 tested patients, telomere seems to be eroded and telomerase activity  insufficiently increased but correlated to the activity of the disease. The  analysis of telomere length and telomerase activity could be useful as prognosis  factor or disease activity index. Telomere erosion could reflect an accelerated  replicative senescence of the immune system. The role of the regulator T  lymphocytes has not yet been precised. Standardized studies on larger population  could be realized in systemic lupus and open new avenues of research and/or  therapy based upon the telomere/telomerase biology.

T1  - Allogenic bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation as a novel 
SP  - 701-9
AB  - IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSC) are  multipotent non-hematopoietic progenitor cells that are being explored as a  promising new treatment for tissue regeneration. Although their immunomodulatory  properties are not yet completely understood, their low immunogenic potential  together with their effects on immune response make them a promising therapeutic  tool for severe refractory autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Our aim is to discuss recent  progress in understanding the role of malfunctioning BMMSC in etiopathogenesis of  SLE and to explore allogenic BMMSC transplantation as a potential therapy for  SLE. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Recent evidence suggests that the functions of  BMMSC are disrupted in SLE pathology. This malfunction may result as a corollary  of the disease, or may play a more fundamental role in its etiopathogenesis. We  provide a brief characterization of BMMSC immunomodulatory effects, and describe  our current understanding of the mechanisms by which it plays a part in treating  SLE. We also present our clinical trial using allogenic BMMSC in this context.  TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Allogenic BMMSC appear to be a safe therapeutic option for  treatment-resistant SLE as illustrated in our clinical trial.

T1  - [Capillaroscopy. Procedure and nomenclature].
SP  - 253-62
AB  - Capillaroscopy has high diagnostic and prognostic value in autoimmune connective  tissue diseases, in particular systemic sclerosis (SSc). Our working group has  developed a consensus on nomenclature, technical equipment, procedure, and  diagnostic interpretation of results. The following are required: binocular  microscopes with at least 20-/50- and 160-/200-fold magnification and digital  archiving. Documentation of defined findings is mandatory. The simultaneous  occurrence of, e.g. caliber variations, ectasia, ramifications, elongation  (length > 350 microm), torsion (at least two crossing segments per capillary  loop), sludge, hemorrhage, and edema is of pathological significance. The  isolated occurrence of bushy capillaries (multiple ramifications), thrombosis,  giant capillary (capillary lumen > 50 microm), and avascular areas also indicates  disease. The latter two findings are highly specific for SSc. Other findings are  consistent with connective tissue diseases. These standardized definitions  increase quality and comparability of nailfold capillaroscopy in Germany.

T1  - B cell-targeted therapies for systemic lupus erythematosus: an update on clinical 
SP  - 529-40
AB  - In the past year there has been remarkable activity and some important success in  the development of B cell-targeted therapies for the treatment of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). The most promising studies were BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, large  phase III studies that demonstrated measurable efficacy for belimumab, a  monoclonal antibody against B cell-activating factor (BAFF). The moderate-sized  phase II/III trials EXPLORER and LUNAR that tested rituximab, an anti-CD20  monoclonal antibody, for treatment of non-renal and renal lupus, disappointed  many investigators with anecdotal success in refractory patients. These rituximab  trials were intended to detect a large clinical effect in patients with very  active disease and this was not found. Nevertheless, arguments can be made for  additional studies in targeted populations or with a change in design to detect  smaller or longer-term effects. Epratuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the B  cell surface antigen CD22, and atacicept, a chimeric molecule formed by a  receptor for BAFF and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) with immunoglobulin  (Ig)-G, have both been promising in initial small trials and now larger clinical  trials are underway. Thus, recent clinical trial data show that B cell-targeting  therapies are beginning to fulfil their promise as treatments for SLE and there  are good reasons to hope for further progress in the near future.

SP  - 1323-6
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for  various plasma cell dyscrasias, but the coexistence of SLE and multiple myeloma  (MM) are rarely reported to date. Due to the rarity, the clinical features of MM  associated with SLE have not been elucidated, and the pathogenesis under this  association remains unclear. In this report, we investigate a 31-year-old woman  with 5-year history of SLE, who is diagnosed as IgA lambda-type MM with multiple lymph  node involvement. We discuss the clinical features of MM in SLE by reviewing  previous cases and possible mechanisms connecting the two conditions.

T1  - Re-evaluation of biologic therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 273-7
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To consider the unmet therapeutic need in lupus and to review  recent open-label data and clinical trials as well as to assess lessons to be  drawn from these studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Open-label data continue to emphasize  the efficacy of rituximab in refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  patients. A number of clinical trials using biologic agents, including rituximab,  have not achieved their primary endpoint; however aspects of trial design such as  the choice of disease activity instrument, use of concomitant medications and  inadequate power to detect a realistic effect may have contributed to the  endpoints not being achieved. Certain subgroups of patients within these trials  also may have responded better than the whole population suggesting that SLE  disease heterogeneity may be an important confounder. Recently, belimumab has  been successful in two phase III trials. These trials employed a novel SLE  responder index (SRI) derived from a secondary analysis of previous phase II  data. SUMMARY: Biological therapy holds much promise in SLE and as we learn more  about the disease and apply the lessons learned from recent trials, we will be in  a strong position to further accelerate drug development in SLE.

SP  - 201-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the unusual occurrence of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) with nephritis in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.  METHODS: Chart review-based report of a case of SLE with diffuse proliferative  glomerulonephritis (DPGN) in an HIV-infected man, together with a literature  review of previously published cases. We searched the English language medical  literature from 1987 to 2009 using the following PubMed and Medline terms: "SLE,"  "HIV," "DPGN." In addition, we researched the role of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  in the treatment of patients with HIV by using the keywords "MMF" and "HIV".  RESULTS: An 18-year-old male patient with vertically transmitted HIV-1 infection  presented with malaise, weight loss, malar rash, arthritis, proteinuria, and  hematuria. Kidney biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of lupus nephritis (Class IV).  He was treated successfully with high-dose corticosteroids and MMF, which were  added to his baseline treatment of highly active antiretroviral therapy. The  review of the literature identified a total of 18 cases of SLE appearing in HIV+  individuals, of which 11 patients had lupus nephritis. Among the latter, there  were only 5 cases of proliferative (focal or diffuse) glomerulonephritis, and  their treatment consisted mainly of high-dose corticosteroids. The short-term  outcome was favorable in 4 cases and 1 patient died. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferative  lupus nephritis is rare in HIV-infected patients. A detailed analysis of the  cases may lead to important insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of both  diseases. Considering its complex interaction with antiviral medications, MMF may  be considered for the treatment of lupus with severe proliferative  glomerulonephritis in HIV-infected individuals.

T1  - Immunoadsorption for systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 110-3
AB  - Immunoadsorption (IAS) with various methods is used as a rescue therapy in  severely ill SLE patients who are refractory to conventional therapeutic  procedures. The method aims at the rapid and extensive removal of pathogenic  immunocomplexes (IC) and (auto-) antibodies (Abs). Long-term observational  studies suggested efficacy and have not seen an increase in the risk of  infections (as were seen in other extracorporeal procedures). Unfortunately,  prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCT) are lacking. Recently,  biologicals aiming at TNF-blockade or B-cell depletion have been used to treat  severe SLE: They are easier to apply since they do not necessitate additional  (expensive) hardware or specially trained staff. While there is emerging evidence  for efficacy from uncontrolled observations, no RCT could so far demonstrate  benefit in SLE. Under these circumstances, IAS still has a role in treating  severe SLE, when other therapies are not effective enough or are contraindicated  (as in pregnancy). These data are reviewed and illustrated in the case of a  pregnant lupus patient with nephrotic syndrome.

T1  - Urinary biomarkers in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 138-50
AB  - Renal involvement in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in the form of  severe lupus nephritis is associated with a significant burden of morbidity and  mortality. Conventional laboratory biomarkers in current use have not been very  successful in anticipating disease flares, predicting renal histology, or  decreasing unwanted outcomes. Since early treatment is associated with improved  clinical results, it is thus essential to identify new biomarkers with  substantial predictive power to reduce the serious sequelae of this difficult to  control lupus manifestation. Indeed, considerable efforts and progress have been  made over the last few years in the search for novel biomarkers. Since urinary  biomarkers are more easily obtainable with much less risk to the patient than  repeat renal biopsies, and these may more accurately discern between renal  disease and other organ manifestations than their serum counterparts, there has  been tremendous interest in studying new candidate urine biomarkers. Below, we  review several promising urinary biomarkers under investigation, including total  proteinuria and microalbuminuria, urinary proteomic signatures, and the  individual inflammatory mediators interleukin-6, vascular cell adhesion  molecule-1, CXCL16, IP-10, and tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of  apoptosis.

SP  - 627-34
AB  - To recognize the clinical characteristics and outcomes of neonatal lupus  erythematosus (NLE), the authors retrospectively review 3 NLE babies in their  department and compared their data with 51 NLE cases reported in the available  Chinese literature between January 1991 and December 2008. Most of the cases were  located near the eastern coast of China, and clinical manifestation of 72.22% of  the cases occurred in 2-week-old babies. Skin findings occurred in 94.44% of the  patients, 12.96% with complete heart block (CHB), 22.22% with thrombocytopenia,  and 14.81% with transient elevated transaminase levels. Cutaneous lesions,  thrombocytopenia, and transaminase level showed improvement; 3 CHB cases had  persisted after 7 to 10 years follow-up, and 1 case died in 5 months. Twenty-four  (44.44%) pregnant woman with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies are  asymptomatic, and antibody status is first indicated when their child shows  symptoms of NLE. Thus, all pregnant women should be screened for anti-Ro/ SSA and  anti-La/SSB antibodies.

T1  - Review: Lupus nephritis: pathologic features, epidemiology and a guide to 
SP  - 557-74
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus may present with renal manifestations that  frequently are difficult to categorize and lupus nephritis is an important  predictor of poor outcome. The type and spectrum of renal injury may remain  undiagnosed until full-blown nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome appear with  increased risk of end-stage renal disease. These abnormalities occur within the  first few years after the diagnosis of lupus is made on clinical grounds and with  the support of laboratory tests in high risk patients. An early renal biopsy is  helpful in patients with an abnormal urinalysis and/or reduced glomerular  filtration rate and the results form the basis for therapeutic decisions. The  biopsy also provides vital prognostic information based on histological  categorization of different types of lupus nephritis, the degree of activity,  chronicity and the immunopathogenesis. In the current armamentarium, the use of  cyclophosphamide and azathioprine and recently mycophenolate mofetil, reduce  morbidity and maintenance therapies reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease.  Clinical trials underway promise new, effective and safe immunosuppressive  regimens for the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis.

T1  - Induction and maintenance therapy for lupus nephritis: a systematic review and 
SP  - 703-10
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the efficacies and toxicities of  immunosuppressive treatments for lupus nephritis (LN) versus cyclophosphamide  (CYC). A meta-analysis was performed to determine treatment efficacy and toxicity  outcomes between mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and CYC induction therapies, between  MMF and azathioprine (AZA) as maintenance therapies, and between low-dose  intravenous (IV) CYC and high-dose IV CYC therapy. Ten randomized controlled  trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. In terms of induction  therapies, MMF did not increase complete remission or partial remission rates as  compared with CYC. However, the relative risks (RRs) of amenorrhea and leukopenia  tended to be lower in the MMF group than in the CYC group. Meta-analysis of MMF  versus AZA as a maintenance therapy showed no difference between the two groups  in terms of response rates or the risk of developing end-stage renal disease.  Low-dose IV CYC therapy had lower relapse rates than high-dose IV CYC therapy (RR  0.465, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.261-0.830, p-value 0.010), and was  associated with a lower infection risk (RR 0.688, 95% CI 0.523-0.905, p-value  0.008). In conclusion, MMF was found to be as effective as CYC and tended to have  a better safety profile as an induction therapy for LN than CYC.

T1  - Mizoribine: a new approach in the treatment of renal disease.
SP  - 681482
AB  - Mizoribine (MZB) is an imidazole nucleoside and an immunosuppressive agent. The  immunosuppressive effect of MZB has been reported to be due to the inhibition of  DNA synthesis in the S phase of the cell cycle. Because of its relative lack of  toxicity, during the past decade MZB has been frequently used instead of  azathioprine as a component of immunosuppressive drug regimens. MZB is being used  to treat renal transplantation patients, IgA nephropathy, lupus erythematosus,  and childhood nephrotic syndrome (NS), and some recent studies have assessed the  efficacy of oral MZB pulse therapy for severe lupus nephritis, steroid-resistant  NS, and frequently relapsing-steroid-dependent NS. This review summarizes the  published findings on the efficacy of MZB for renal disease including IgA  nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and NS, as well as of oral MZB pulse therapy for  severe lupus nephritis and NS, and also the mechanism of the effect of oral MZB  pulse therapy on the lymphocyte cell cycle.

T1  - B-cell-depletion therapy in SLE--what are the current prospects for its 
SP  - 711-6
AB  - Analogous to the successful introduction of biologic agents to treat rheumatoid  arthritis, it was widely envisaged that similar successful studies would follow  in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as much was known about the  etiopathogenesis of the disease and appropriate agents to block the key cells and  molecules were available. The reality, however, has been different. The failure  of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that induces B-cell depletion, to meet its  primary and secondary end points in trials of nonrenal SLE (EXPLORER) and renal  (LUNAR) lupus nephritis has been disappointing given the success reported in many  open-label studies. Concluding that B-cell-depletion therapy is not effective in  SLE seems rather extreme. Further analysis of the as-yet unpublished results and  their comparison with data from published studies might provide insight into  whether B-cell depletion will eventually be accepted as a useful approach for the  treatment of SLE.

SP  - 609-24
AB  - This review provides a theoretical background and approach for developing outcome  measures that are often used to assess the state and course of paediatric  rheumatic diseases. It describes the important steps in scale development such as  item generation and reduction, the assessment of scale reliability and various  forms of validation. The second part of this review described the newly developed  outcome measures as well as their state of validation. These outcome measures  include therapeutic response measures, composite disease activity scores for  juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), global disease activity tools for juvenile  systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile dermatomyositis, disease status  measures in JIA, measures of physical function, measures of health-related  quality of life, clinical measures of damage and radiographic scoring systems in  JIA.

T1  - Demystifying neuropsychiatric lupus--is it possible?
SP  - 276-80
AB  - The occurrence of nervous system events in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to the  diversity of clinical manifestations, the correction attribution of events to SLE  or other causes, and the lack of clinical trial data to facilitate the selection  of treatment options. Over the past decade the classifcation and attribution of  neuropsychiatric (NP) events has received more rigorous attention and new  insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms have emerged through neuroimaging  studies and elucidation of autoimmune and infammatory mechanisms. Although much  work remains to be done on this complex and fascinating aspect of lupus, there is  an emerging consensus on the pathogenesis and treatment of NP-SLE.

T1  - Updates on lupus and pregnancy.
SP  - 271-5
AB  - This review focuses on events subsequent to planning a pregnancy and addresses  three components of concern for women with systemic lupus erythematosus:  maternal, placental, and fetal. Flare rates are generally low for patients who  are clinically stable at conception. For patients who have never had renal  disease, there is no frm evidence that they will develop active renal disease  simply due to being pregnant. For patients who begin pregnancy with an abnormal  creatinine (> 2 mg/dl is ill advised), risks include hypertension, preeclampsia,  high rate of fetal loss, and possible further deterioration of renal function.  Discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor  blockers, and mycophenalate is mandatory. Elevated levels of sVEGF-1 may be a  harbinger of preeclampsia. For patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies  detected in the frst trimester of pregnancy, the lupus anticoagulant per se may  be the strongest predictor of pregnancy complications. For women with anti-SSA/Ro  antibodies the risk of having a child with congenital heart block is 2% which  rises to a recurrence rate of 18%. Information on current approaches to  prevention and treatment of heart complications of neonatal lupus is provided.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy.
SP  - 457-74
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-system autoimmune connective tissue  disorder that primarily affects women of childbearing age. While it has been long  recognized that pregnancies in SLE patients are high risk to both mother and  fetus, pregnancy outcomes in women with SLE have significantly improved over the  last four decades. However, the incidences of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth,  intra-uterine growth retardation, and prematurity are increased at least two-fold  compared with the normal population. Maternal renal disease, and particularly  active lupus nephritis, impaired renal function, and hypertension at the time of  conception are strong predictor of adverse fetal outcome. Another major  contributor to adverse SLE pregnancy outcomes is antiphospholipid syndrome (APS),  defined as the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody (APL) in association with  clinic features of venous/arterial thrombosis or specific pregnancy  complications. APS is frequently seen in association with SLE and has been linked  to recurrent fetal loss. Normal renal function, controlled blood pressure, and  the absence of APL/APS are predictors of favorable fetal outcomes. The risk for  flare may be a function of the disease activity prior to pregnancy. There-fore,  to avoid further exacerbation of lupus activity by pregnancy, planned conception  in SLE patients is advisable, ideally 12-18, but not less than 6 months, after an  established remission. As the care of these patients frequently crosses  specialties, it should encompass consultations with nephrology and rheu-matology.  Postnatal maternal monitoring by a nephrologist is indicated for optimization of  hypertension and lupus nephritis treatment, without concerns for  medication-related fetal adverse effects.

T1  - Diagnostic value of transesophageal echocardiography in Libman-Sacks 
SP  - 467-81
AB  - Libman-Sacks endocarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation in patients  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome  (PAPS); it is characterized by Libman-Sacks vegetations, valve thickening or  fibrosis, valve regurgitation, and rarely valve stenosis. It is most commonly  clinically manifested with cardioembolism (predominantly to the brain),  uncommonly with symptomatic severe valve regurgitation, or rarely with over  imposed infective endocarditis. These three clinical syndromes are associated  with a five to eight times higher morbidity and mortality than in a general  population. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is infrequently detected by the history and  cardiovascular physical examination; it is detected by transthoracic  echocardiography (TTE) in 30-40% as compared to 60-80% of patients by  transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Also, TTE as compared to TEE has low  sensitivity (63% overall, 11% for valve vegetations), low specificity (58%), low  negative predictive value (40%), and a moderate positive predictive value (78%)  for the detection of Libman-Sacks endocarditis. In addition, TEE has played a  major role in our current understanding of the specific characteristics,  evolution, assessment of prognosis, and defining the need and response to medical  or surgical therapy of Libman-Sacks endocarditis. Therefore, an increased  awareness of the potential clinical complications of Libman-Sacks endocarditis  and application of echocardiography, especially of TEE, may lead to an earlier  and accurate diagnosis, guidance of therapy, prevention of complications,  decreased rate of progression of the disease, and consequently to an event free  survival of patients with SLE or PAPS.

T1  - Relevance of anti-C1q autoantibodies to lupus nephritis.
SP  - 243-51
AB  - The first component of the classical pathway of the complement system (C1q) is  considered to have a crucial role in the clearance of immune complexes (ICs) as  well as in the removal of waste material originating from apoptotic cells. A  prolonged exposure of C1q epitopes to the immune system could eventually lead to  an autoimmune response against itself. Although autoantibodies against C1q are  found in several diseases, their clinical interest originates from their strong  association to active lupus nephritis (LN). Several studies indicate that  anti-C1q autoantibodies could serve as a reliable serologic marker in the  assessment of LN activity compared to other immunological tests. Additionally, it  was suggested that anti-C1q autoantibodies could play a role in LN pathogenesis.  Their potential pathogenic actions likely depend on genetic background, titers,  Ig classes and subclasses, and specific epitopes of anti-C1q autoantibodies as  well as C1q availability and allocation. It is still unclear which different  types of anti-C1q autoantibodies dominate in each case and if their upregulation  is pathogenic, an epiphenomenon of aberrant tissue damage, or compensatory to an  uncontrolled immune response.

T1  - Clinical approach to lupus nephritis: recent advances.
SP  - 447-53
AB  - Kidney involvement is common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Its clinical  presentations are highly variable, ranging from mild asymptomatic proteinuria  and/or hematuria to rapidly progressive uremia. Histological evidence of lupus  nephritis is present in most patients with SLE, even when they do not yet have  clinical manifestations. Current classification ISN/RPS 2003 (International  Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society) of lupus nephritis was promoted by  a widely perceived need to re-examine existing classification, provide clearer  distinctions between the histological classes, and improve diagnostic  reproducibility and interobserver agreement. Lupus nephritis is a serious disease  whose prognosis can usually be improved dramatically by treatment, but treatment  is potentially toxic, prolonged, and complex. Current treatment regimens combine  corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or ciclosporin; mycophenolate  mofetil has received much recent attention as a potentially immune suppressive  agent and less aggressive immunosuppressive regimens can be prescribed. SLE  patients should be regular followed to detect early kidney involvement.

T1  - A perspective on B-cell-targeting therapy for SLE.
SP  - 1-10
AB  - In recent years, large controlled trials have tested several new agents for  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Unfortunately, none of these trials has met  its primary outcome. This does not mean progress has not been made. In fact, a  great deal has been learned about doing clinical trials in lupus and about the  biological and clinical effects of the drugs being tested. Many of these drugs  were designed to target B cells directly, e.g., rituximab, belimumab,  epratuzumab, and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin  ligand interactor-immunoglobulin (TACI-Ig). The enthusiasm for targeting B cells  derives from substantial evidence showing the critical role of B cells in murine  models of SLE, as well promising results from multiple open trials with  rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes B  cells (Martin and Chan in Immunity 20(5):517-527, 2004; Sobel et al. in J Exp Med  173:1441-1449, 1991; Silverman and Weisman in Arthritis Rheum 48:1484-1492, 2003;  Silverman in Arthritis Rheum 52(4):1342, 2005; Shlomchik et al. in Nat Rev  Immunol 1:147-153, 2001; Looney et al. in Arthritis Rheum 50:2580-2589, 2004; Lu  et al. in Arthritis Rheum 61(4):482-487, 2009; Saito et al. in Lupus  12(10):798-800, 2003; van Vollenhoven et al. in Scand J Rheumatol 33(6):423-427,  2004; Sfikakis et al. Arthritis Rheum 52(2):501-513, 2005). Why have the  controlled trials of B-cell-targeting therapies failed to demonstrate efficacy?  Were there flaws in design or execution of these trials? Or, were promising  animal studies and open trials misleading, as so often happens? This perspective  discusses the current state of B-cell-targeting therapies for human lupus and the  future development of these therapies.

T1  - [Autoimmune diseases associated with transverse myelitis. Review].
SP  - 251-70
AB  - Transverse myelitis (TM) is an inflammatory process involving restricted areas of  the spinal cord. The usually dramatic presentation with rapidly progressive  symptoms involving motor, sensory and autonomic functions makes acute TM a  medical emergency. Acute TM has been cited as a rare and unusual complication of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS), but early  diagnosis and aggressive treatment might improve the prognosis. This review of  the literature (MEDLINE), showed that, within autoimmune diseases, acute  transverse myelitis is mainly associated with SLE and SS. Previous studies seem  to indicate that the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies might play a role in  the etiology of TM. Although no uniform therapeutic protocol exists, and the  prognosis is usually poor, early aggressive treatment (usually with EV pulses of  methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide) might improve the prognosis.

AB  - System lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by  the production of autoantibodies that cause widespread tissue damage. The  underlying etiology remains largely unknown. Aberrant epigenetics plays essential  roles in the pathogenesis of SLE. This review explores the links between DNA  methylation, histone modifications, and miRNAs in SLE and highlights how these  factors may interact in SLE pathogenesis. We also discuss how furthering our  knowledge of epigenetics in lupus provides hope for finding new diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets and strategies.

SP  - 1989-96
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the cases of 13 lupus nephritis children with pure  membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN; Group A) and ten children with mixed  proliferative and membranous nephritis (Group B). The children were identified  through a territory-wide survey of patients between 1990 and 2003. All were  ethnic Chinese. Age at diagnosis ranged from 3.7 to 18.6 years (Group A) and from  9.6 to 22.1 years (Group B). Female-to-male ratios were 12:1 (Group A) and 9:1  (Group B). Group A patients were more often nephrotic than Group B patients  (11/13 vs. 5/10, p = 0.17). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at presentation  was normal in all but two patients (one from each group). For induction, Group B  patients consistently received prednisolone and cyclophosphamide; in contrast,  the cytotoxic regimens in Group A patients varied from cyclophosphamide (five  patients), mycophenolate mofetil (two patients), azathiorpine plus cyclosporine  (one patient), and azathioprine alone (one patient). After a median follow-up of  7.6-7.8 years, one Group A patient had died of fulminant lupus. One survivor in  Group B had a GFR < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Proteinuria persisted in five Group  A patients and two Group B patients. In conclusion, Group B patients had good  prognosis in terms of survival and proteinuria control. The only death occurred  in Group A, and five of the 12 survivors in this group had persistent  proteinuria. Further studies are needed to define the best treatment for pure  lupus MGN.

T1  - Pregnancy and systemic lupus erythematosus: review of clinical features and 
SP  - 302-6
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is mainly a disease of fertile women and the  coexistence of pregnancy is by no means a rare event. How SLE and its treatment  affects pregnancy outcome is still a matter of debate. Assessment of the  reciprocal clinical impact of SLE and pregnancy was investigated in a cohort  study. We reviewed the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of 43 pregnant  SLE patients with 51 pregnancies followed from 1993 to 2007 at a tertiary  university hospital. The age of patients was 28.7 +/- 5.4 years and SLE was  diagnosed at age of 23.0 +/- 6.1 years. Previous manifestations of SLE included  lupus nephritis (14 patients) and secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (11  patients). Thirty-five pregnant patients (69%) were in remission for more than 6  months at the onset of pregnancy. Patients were being treated with low doses of  prednisone (29), hydroxychloroquine (20), azathioprine (five), acetylsalicylic  acid (51), and low molecular weight heparin (13). Sixteen pregnancy-associated  flares were documented, mainly during the second trimester (42%) and also in the  following year after delivery (25%). Renal involvement was found in 11 cases  (68%). Spontaneous abortion occurred in 6%, 16% had premature deliveries, and 74%  were delivered at term. No cases of maternal mortality occurred. No cases of  fetal malformation were recorded. There was one intrauterine fetal death and one  neonatal death at 24 gestational weeks. Pregnant women with SLE are high risk  patients, but we had a 90% success rate in our cohort. A control disease activity  strategy to target clinical remission is essential.

T1  - Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products: a new biomarker in 
SP  - 1190-6
AB  - The formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is a result of the  non-enzymatic reaction between sugars and free amino groups of proteins. AGEs,  through interacting with their specific receptor for AGEs (RAGE), result in  activation of pro-inflammatory states and are involved in numerous pathologic  situations. The soluble form of RAGE (sRAGE) is able to act as a decoy to avoid  interaction of RAGE with its pro-inflammatory ligands (AGEs, HMGB1, S100  proteins). sRAGE levels have been found to be decreased in chronic inflammatory  diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, renal failure and the aging  process. The use of measuring circulating sRAGEs may prove to be a valuable  vascular biomarker and in this review, we describe the implications of sRAGE in  inflammation and propose that this molecule may represent a future therapeutic  target in chronic inflammatory diseases.

SP  - 478-82
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To describe the results of two recent prospective studies that  may indicate how to monitor, diagnose, and treat fetuses with neonatal lupus  manifesting with heart involvement and to summarize additional research reports  regarding the pathophysiology and outcomes of this rare condition. RECENT  FINDINGS: The PR Interval and Dexamethasone Evaluation study found 10 cases of  neonatal lupus (10%) with three first-degree atrioventricular blocks (AVBs) and  three complete heart blocks. The study included 98 pregnancies in 95 women with  anti-SSA/Ro antibodies who completed weekly fetal Doppler echocardiogram-based  evaluation. The authors concluded that they were unable to detect first-degree  AVB before progression to complete heart block. A similar observational  prospective study was performed in 70 fetuses of 56 mothers using tissue velocity  fetal kinetocardiogram for measurement of PR prolongation. In this study, six  fetuses (8.5%) showed first-degree AVB, and fast normalization of heart function  was achieved through maternal treatment with fluorinated steroids. The authors  concluded that fetal kinetocardiogram can detect first-degree AVB in the fetus  exposed to maternal anti-SSA/Ro or anti-SSB/La antibodies or both and that  fluorinated steroids given on detection were associated with normalized  atrioventricular conduction in fetuses with first-degree AVB. SUMMARY: Echo  Doppler seems a less reliable method for early detection of fetus first-degree  AVB, and it is suggested that fetal kinetocardiogram or fetal electrocardiography  are preferred. Although atrioventricular block reverses spontaneously in some  fetuses, parents and treating physicians should consider immediate treatment with  fluorinated steroids once a first-degree AVB is detected due to the high risk of  rapid progression to complete blockage.

SP  - 777-84
AB  - Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a rare but life-threatening complication of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We present the case of a 24-year-old  Cambodian woman with SLE followed in the Brigham and Women's Hospital Lupus  Center in Boston, Massachusetts. She presented with dyspnoea and chest pain and  was found to have DAH that required a prolonged hospitalization that was  complicated by recurrent DAH episodes and multiple infections. We discuss the  diagnostic approach and management of patients with SLE-associated DAH as well as  treatment options for refractory disease. Emerging therapies include  plasmapheresis, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and recombinant  activated Factor VII therapy. In addition, we review the literature to date and  compile what is known about the epidemiology, presenting features, diagnostic  findings, management and outcomes in this condition. We found that DAH has been  reported in 1.9% of patients with SLE. These patients were mostly female (88%)  and young (mean age 30.2 years). Common presenting features included dyspnoea  (94%), anaemia (97%) and new radiographic chest infiltrate (99%). Bronchoscopy,  when performed, identified DAH in 90% of cases. Corticosteroids were the mainstay  of care, and usage of cyclophosphamide varied by report. Despite recent advances  in therapy, mortality has not improved substantially (48% overall survival versus  53% survival in reports published since 1993).

T1  - Rituximab in systemic lupus erythematosus: A systematic review of off-label use 
SP  - 767-76
AB  - The complexity of the therapeutic approach in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  is increased by the large number of patients who do not respond to the first-line  therapies and by relapses after initial clinical remission. In these patients,  second-line drugs are often prescribed according to individual clinical  decisions. The emergence of biological therapies has increased the therapeutic  armamentarium available in these complex situations, but their use is limited by  the lack of licensing. Available data on the use of rituximab in SLE rely on a  large number of case reports and some observational studies. We analyzed current  evidence on the therapeutic use of rituximab in adult SLE patients by a  systematic review of reports included in the PubMed database between 2002 and  2007. A total of 188 SLE patients treated with rituximab were identified; 171  (91%) patients showed a significant improvement in one or more of the systemic  SLE manifestations. There were 103 patients with lupus nephritis, with an overall  rate of therapeutic response of renal involvement of 91%. Adverse events were  reported in 44 (23%) patients; the most frequent were infections (19%). Although  it is not yet possible to make definite recommendations, the global analysis of  all cases reported to date support the off-label use of rituximab in severe,  refractory SLE cases, whereas its use as a first-line therapy or in patients with  a predominantly mild form of the disease is not advised.

SP  - 608-12
AB  - Pericardial effusions causing pericardial tamponade are rare in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The goal of this study is to describe in  detail the clinical and laboratory characteristics of a group of patients with  pericardial effusions and pericardial tamponade secondary to SLE. We  retrospectively reviewed the records of 71 patients with SLE, admitted to our  Hospital between 1985 and 2006 with a diagnosis of pericarditis, pericardial  effusion and tamponade. Clinical features in the patients with tamponade were  compared with those with pericardial effusions without tamponade. Pericardial  effusion and SLE was confirmed in 41 patients. Pericardial tamponade occurred in  nine of these patients (21.9%) at the time of presentation. All tamponade  patients were women. Patients with pericardial effusions who developed tamponade  had a statistically significant (P = 0.05) lower C4 level as compared with  patients who did not develop tamponade. A pericardial window was required in five  patients even though the patients were receiving high-dose corticosteroids. In  the present series, all patients with tamponade were treated with high-dose  corticosteroids though five of nine patients required a pericardial window in  contrast to previous studies. A low C4 level at presentation was predictive of  the development of tamponade physiology.

SP  - 867-72
AB  - Evolution of immunopathological diseases is usually slow and progressive.  Non-differentiated collagen disease (NDC) or the term "undifferentiated  connective tissue disease" (UCTD) represents a stage of disease where clinical  symptoms and serological abnormalities suggest autoimmune disease, but they are  not sufficient to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of any well-established  connective tissue disease (CTD) such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  Sjogren's syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), systemic sclerosis  (SSc), polymyositis/ dermatomyositis (PM/DM) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 30-40  percent of patients presenting undifferentiated profile develops and reaches the  stage of a well defined systemic autoimmune disease during five years follow up,  while 60 percent remains in an undifferentiated stage.In the stage of NDC,  immunoregulatory abnormalities and endothelial dysfunction are present. In  conclusion, NDC represents a dynamic state, and it is important to recognize the  possibility of a progression to a definite systemic autoimmune disease.

SP  - 205-8, 210-13
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a classic systemic autoimmune disease.  Standard treatment consists of chronic therapy with antimalarials,  glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive/cytotoxic drugs, which is associated with  considerable side effects. In contrast, immunoablation of autoreactive  immunologic memory followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has  been the only regimen capable of inducing long-term remission of up to 10 years  after cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, even in severely affected patients.  Introduced in 1996, the procedure has since been performed in 147 patients with  severe SLE refractory to standard treatment in clinical studies worldwide. Most  of these patients achieved clinical long-term remission. However, SLE relapses  and secondary autoimmune disorders have been reported. Transplant-related  mortality occurred in 6% of the 147 cases, with a wide center effect (2-13%).  Here we summarise the results published in the literature on immunoablation  followed by ASCT in SLE and discuss future perspectives for optimising this  therapeutic approach. It may be possible to improve the outcome and reduce the  risks of treatment by identifying patients with a poor prognosis at an early  stage, before irreversible organ damage has taken place.

T1  - Myelitis in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus: review.
SP  - 67-72
AB  - Myelopathy manifested clinically as acute longitudinal or transverse myelitis  constitutes one of the most severe and rare neuropsychiatric manifestations of  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1-3% of patients). Myelitis has been observed  less commonly in other connective tissue diseases, mostly in antiphospholipid  syndrome, and rarely in Sjogren's syndrome, Behcet's disease and mixed connective  tissue disease. Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) may also be present in diseases  of various etiology, including multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, infectious  diseases and malignancies. Myelitis in SLE is manifested as a dramatic spinal  cord injury leading to paralysis or muscular paresis, sensory deficits, and  smooth muscle dysfunction usually in the form of sphincter dysfunction. The  imaging technique of choice in case of suspected ATM is magnetic resonance  imaging with intravenous contrast agent (gadolinium  diethylenetriamine-pentaacid). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination in patients  with ATM in the course of SLE indicate usually pleocytosis with prevalence of  granulocytes, increased protein levels, low glucose levels, significantly  hindering differential diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. Observations  made by the authors (2 female patients with SLE) show that antibodies specific to  SLE can be found in the CSF collected in the acute phase of myelitis. These  observations have not yet been confirmed by other researchers. Early introduction  of intravenous immunosuppression with large doses of cyclophosphamide and  glucocorticosteroids improves the long-term prognosis. Other therapeutic  approaches have been also used in more severe cases. Even with appropriate  therapy, prognosis in this disease is uncertain.

T1  - Disparities in lupus care and outcomes.
SP  - 102-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory rheumatic  disease characterized by autoantibody production and diverse clinical  manifestations, disproportionately affects vulnerable groups: women, racial and  ethnic minorities, the poor and those lacking medical insurance and education. We  summarize the current knowledge of the disparities observed in SLE and highlight  recent research that aims to dissect the causes of these disparities and identify  the potentially modifiable factors contributing to them. RECENT FINDINGS: Several  remediable causes, including lack of education, self-efficacy and access to  quality, experienced healthcare have been found to contribute to observed  disparities in SLE prevalence and outcomes. SUMMARY: SLE is associated with  alarming disparities in incidence, severity and outcomes. The causes of these  disparities are under study by several research groups. Identifying potentially  correctable contributory factors should allow the development of effective  strategies to improve the healthcare delivery and outcomes in all SLE patients.

SP  - 150-3
AB  - Secretion of pathogenic antibodies by long-lived plasma cells which are resistant  to conventional treatment may essentially contribute to refractory systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). Here we introduce two novel therapies that also deplete  long-lived plasma cells: 1. Immunoablation with anti-thymocyte globulin followed  by autologous stem cell transplantation has already been successfully used in  patients with SLE. 2. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, approved for the  treatment of multiple myeloma, efficiently depletes short- and long-lived plasma  cells and ameliorates lupus nephritis in mouse models. These novel therapies may  improve the future treatment of SLE and other antibody-mediated diseases.

T1  - Usefulness of ISN/RPS classification of lupus nephritis.
SP  - S7-10
AB  - About 50-80% of patients with lupus suffer from lupus nephritis which is one of  major causes of morbidity and mortality. Renal pathologists and nephrologists  should evaluate the degree of histological damages to establish therapeutic plans  for lupus nephritis. In order to standardize definitions, to emphasize clinically  relevant lesions, and to improve interobserver reproducibility, the International  Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) classification was  proposed. Recently, several retrospective validation studies concerning the  utility of the ISN/RPS classification, especially among class IV, were performed.  In these reports, reproducibility is improved by the definition of diagnostic  term, but the outcome related with classification, especially in class IV, is  controversial. We performed retrospective analysis of 99 biopsy-proven subjects  with lupus nephritis in our facility using the ISN/RPS classification. The class  IV-G group tended to exhibit a worse renal outcome, but the difference compared  with IV-S was not significant. In a Cox proportional hazards models, Independent  histological predictors of poor renal outcome were extracapillary proliferation,  glomerular sclerosis and fibrous crescents, while hyaline thrombi and fibrous  adhesions were of favorable renal outcome. Both were similarly observed in IV-G  and IV-S. The more qualitative categorization by the response to standard  treatment may be needed to emphasize clinically relevant lesion related to renal  outcome.

SP  - 233-48
AB  - CONTEXT: Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease with protean  clinical and pathologic manifestations involving almost all organs in the body.  There is a high incidence of renal involvement during the course of the disease,  with varied renal pathologic lesions and diverse clinical features. A renal  biopsy examined by routine light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron  microscopy contributes toward diagnosis, prognostic information, and appropriate  management. OBJECTIVES: (1) To review the clinical and various pathologic  features of renal lesions in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. (2) To  introduce the International Society of Nephrology and Renal Pathology Society  Classification of Lupus Glomerulonephritis. DATA SOURCES: A literature review,  illustrations with original artwork, and tabulation of clinical and pathologic  data of cases obtained from the authors' renal biopsy files examined during the  last 8 years were used. CONCLUSIONS: The International Society of Nephrology/  Renal Pathology Society-sponsored Classification of Lupus Glomerulonephritis  proposes standardized definitions of the various pathologic findings, describes  clinically relevant lesions, incorporates prognostic parameters, and recommends a  uniform way of reporting the renal biopsy findings. Lupus glomerulonephritis is  divided into 6 classes primarily based on the morphologic lesions, extent and  severity of the involvement, immune complex deposition, and activity and  chronicity. Special emphasis is laid on describing qualitative as well as  quantitative morphologic data and to include the accompanying tubulointerstitial  disease and different vascular lesions, which have prognostic and therapeutic  significance. This classification is intended to facilitate a higher degree of  reproducibility, resulting in better patient care and more effective future  clinical and translational research. Renal biopsy findings in systemic lupus  erythematosus add new and independent parameters of prognostic significance to  established clinical and genetic factors.

T1  - Monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 26-37
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by B  cell hyperactivity and defective T-cell function, with production of high titer  autoantibodies. In the recent years, conceptual advances and the introduction of  new therapies are yielding improvements in the management of this disease. In  recent years, clinical studies have been undertaken with selected monoclonal  antibodies (mAbs) in the treatment of SLE. The important role of B cells in the  pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders has provided a strong rationale to target B  cells in SLE. Selective therapeutic depletion of B-cells became possible with the  availability of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and anti-CD22 antibody  epratuzumab. Several clinical studies confirm high activity of rituximab in SLE  patients especially with lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric involvement.  Recently, several new mAbs reacting with CD20 have been developed. New mAbs  directed against CD20 include fully human mAb ofatumumab (HuMax CD20), IMMU-106  (hA20) which has a >90% humanized framework and GA-101, a novel third-generation  fully humanized and optimized mAb. These agents are highly cytotoxic against  B-cell lymphoid cells. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis  factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and iterleukin-6 (IL-6) play an important role in  propagating the inflammatory process responsible for tissue damage. Blocking of  these cytokines by mAbs can be also a successful therapy for patients with SLE.  Finally, mAb eculizumab that specifically inhibits terminal complement activation  has been recently developed and investigated in the phase I single dose study in  SLE. In this review, new mAbs, potentially useful in SLE are presented.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic intermittent autoimmune  disease, which can affect nearly all organ systems. The disease is characterized  by the detection of more than 100 different auto-antibodies. For the clinical  practice as well as in controlled clinical studies it is absolutely necessary to  define target criteria which allow the evaluation of the effectiveness of  therapy. Many instruments are available for measuring the activity of the  disease, the quality of life, the extent of irreversible damage and the  individual manifestation in organs. There are also now various biomarkers to  characterize the pathophysiologic aspects, clinical activity, therapeutic  effectiveness and prognosis.

AB  - AIM: To reveal the priorities of Russian rheumatology to develop treatment  options for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data  available in the Russian and foreign literature, the archives and publications by  the researchers of the Institute of Rheumatology on systemic lupus erythematosus  in 1958 to 2008 were analyzed. RESULTS: Analyzing the literature references has  ascertained that the researchers of the Institute of Rheumatology, Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences, have initiated studies to develop therapy methods  for SLE since 1958. Diagnostic criteria for and SLE course type definitions and  classification have been first developed in Russian and foreign medicine; the  principles of optimal glucocorticoid, cytostatic therapy, and follow-up of  patients with SLE have been proposed on the basis of a long-term observation. In  Russian medicine, the Institute's researchers have first developed an algorithm  of therapy for lupus nephritis, by using plasmapheresis, pulse therapy with  methylprednisolone and cyclophosphan, and suppressing and maintaining doses of  glucocorticoids. The practical application of the SLE treatment methods developed  at the Institute have reduced mortality and increased 10-year survival in  patients with SLE up to 90%. The Institute of Rheumatology has first provided  data on the efficiency of anti-B-cell therapy for SLE in Russian rheumatology.  CONCLUSION: Prognosis in patients with SLE has substantially changed in the past  50 years. The Russian rheumatologists have studied the clinical manifestations of  the disease in detail; its diagnosis has improved; the specific features of SLE  have been revealed; the treatment methods adequate to the clinical manifestations  of the disease have been developed. Multicomponent therapy for SLE, monitoring,  and follow-ups have solved the problem of curing SLE.

T1  - [Treatment of post-transplant glomerulonephritis].
SP  - 99-106
AB  - The treatment of recurrent glomerulonephritis (GN) is often empirical.  Plasmapheresis has received the largest consensus for the treatment of focal  glomerular sclerosis (FGS), whether associated with cyclophosphamide and steroids  or not. To be effective, such therapy needs to be started as quickly as possible  after the onset of proteinuria, and prolonged for months when recovery is  delayed. Plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide have also been used to treat GNs  with glomerular crescents. However, there has been no consensus on the efficacy  of such therapy. The recently introduced rituximab is the most innovative drug  but also the most experimental. So far, it has been used for the treatment of  ANCA-associated vasculitis, FGS and membranous GN, with results that are still  under debate. Cyclophosphamide has been used in patients with severe recurrent  GN, but the anedoctal cases described prevent us from drawing any firm  conclusions. Steroids have been used for the treatment of many recurrent GNs, but  yet again, without any standard protocol. They have been used both in children  with FGS and in adults with aggressive GN or severe proteinuria. Both ACE  inhibitors and angiotensinreceptor blockers have been suggested as first-line  therapy in recurrent GN with proteinuria. This therapy is safe and can be even  more effective than others. Finally, it must be kept in mind that the addition of  immunosuppression in transplant patients can dramatically increase the risk of  infective complications. Moreover, recurrent GNs are often associated with  chronic allograft diseases that can cause graft worsening independently of any  therapy.

AB  - What's new in medicine in 2007? Find out what has changed in medicine in 2007 in  the field of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The year has been productive  with many fundamental advances. 2007 was the year of genetics in autoimmune  diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, vascularities, etc.), coming  notably from work by the WTCCC. The comprehension of inflammatory diseases is  based on increasingly detailed knowledge of epigenetic regulation and  posttranscriptional mechanisms. The small RNA play a fundamental role and  potentially offer many therapeutic applications.Sex and stress play a role in the  appearance of inflammatory diseases. The mechanisms are progressively being  better understood.More and more illnesses have autoimmune mechanisms, such as  emphysema in the ex-smoker or pustulosis palmaris et plantaris. The revolution in  biological therapies is continuing to grow. Medications that modulate innate  immunity are being evaluated in inflammatory, allergic, and neoplastic diseases.  Other, sometimes surprising options such as arsenic are now possible.

AB  - The "catastrophic" variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is  characterized by multiple vascular occlusive events, usually affecting small  vessels and developing over a short period of time. Although patients with  catastrophic APS represent less than 1% of all patients with APS, they are  usually in a life-threatening situation with a 50% mortality rate. The purpose of  this paper is to review the treatment strategies and prognostic factors in  patients with catastrophic APS. A detailed description of the clinical and  laboratory features of the syndrome can be found in the other articles of this  issue.

Malignancy may play a pathogenic role in patients with CAPS, whereas  infections are more important as triggering factors in patients without  malignancies. CAPS patients with malignancies are generally older than CAPS  patients without malignancies; they generally have the worst prognosis of the  entire CAPS cohort.

T1  - Use of rituximab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: an update.
SP  - 343-8
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, occasionally life threatening,  multisystem disorder. Patients suffer from a wide group of symptoms and have a  variable prognosis that depends of the severity and type of organ involvement.  The clinical manifestations include fever, skin lesions, arthritis, neurologic,  renal, cardiac, and pulmonary disease. The pathogenesis of this serious  multisystem autoimmune disease is based on polyclonal B cell immunity, which  involves connective tissue and blood vessels. The novel biologic therapies have  raised hope for more effective and safer treatment for SLE. Although definitive  studies are still under development, the impressive preliminary results of  therapies specifically targeting B cells and the signaling pathways involved in  B-T-cell interactions suggest that the depletion of memory cells accounts, at  least in part, for the clinical efficacy of rituximab therapy in patients whose  disease is resistant to other immunosuppressive therapies. However these  findings, although provocative, require further investigation in larger cohorts.

T1  - Acute viral infections in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: description 
SP  - 311-318
AB  - Few studies have evaluated the impact of viral infections on the daily management  of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We analyzed the etiology and  clinical features of acute viral infections arising in patients with SLE and  their influence on the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of SLE. Cases  occurring within the last 5 years were selected from the databases of 3 large  teaching hospitals. Acute viral infections were confirmed by the identification  of specific antiviral IgM antibodies and subsequent seroconversion with detection  of specific IgG antibodies. In autopsy studies, macroscopic findings suggestive  of viral infection were confirmed by direct identification of the virus or  viruses in tissue samples. We performed a MEDLINE search for additional cases  reported between January 1985 and March 2008. We included 88 cases (23 from our  clinics and 65 from the literature review) of acute viral infections in patients  with SLE. Twenty-five patients were diagnosed with new-onset SLE (fulfillment of  the 1997 SLE criteria) associated with infection by human parvovirus B19 (n =  15), cytomegalovirus (CMV; n = 6), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; n = 3), and hepatitis  A virus (n = 1). The remaining 63 cases of acute viral infections arose in  patients already diagnosed with SLE: in 18 patients, symptoms related to  infection mimicked a lupus flare, 36 patients, including 1 patient from the  former group who presented with both conditions, presented organ-specific viral  infections (mainly pneumonitis, colitis, retinitis, and hepatitis), and 10  patients presented a severe, multiorgan process similar to that described in  catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome-the final diagnosis was hemophagocytic  syndrome in 5 cases and disseminated viral infection in 5. Twelve patients died  due to infection caused by CMV (n = 5), herpes simplex virus (n = 4), EBV (n =  2), and varicella zoster virus (n = 1). Autopsies were performed in 9 patients  and disclosed disseminated herpetic infection in 6 patients (caused by herpes  simplex in 4 cases, varicella in 1, and CMV in 1) and hemophagocytic syndrome in  3. A higher frequency of renal failure (54% vs. 19%, p = 0.024), antiphospholipid  syndrome (33% vs. 6%, p = 0.023), treatment with cyclophosphamide (82% vs. 37%, p  = 0.008), and multisystemic involvement at presentation (58% vs. 8%, p < 0.001);  and a lower frequency of antiviral therapy (18% vs. 76%, p < 0.001) were found in  patients who died, compared with survivors. The most common viral infections in  patients with SLE are parvovirus B19 (predominantly mimicking SLE presentation)  and CMV (predominantly presenting in severely immunosuppressed patients). CMV  infection may mimic a lupus flare or present with specific organ involvement such  as gastrointestinal bleeding or pulmonary infiltrates. Other herpesviruses are  common in immunosuppressed SLE patients and may produce a wide range of  manifestations. Physicians should examine the pharynx, eyes, skin, and genitalia  and should conduct serologic and molecular studies to improve early detection of  viral infection in patients with SLE.

T1  - Is there a place for postmenopausal hormone therapy use in women with lupus?
SP  - 247-54
AB  - The Women Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials have reported increase in  cardiovascular and breast cancer risks from the use of post-menopausal hormone  therapy (HT). A striking decrease of HT use has been observed worldwide despite  the fact that other regimens in younger post-menopausal women could be safer.  Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) is considered as estrogen sensitive. HT is  generally considered as contraindicated in these women who are especially at risk  for cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis. However, recent randomized trials  have raised the question of a lack of deleterious effects of estrogen containing  oral contraceptives. In view of the recent knowledge and understanding in the  field of menopause the authors were interested to examine the HT effects in women  with SLE by analysis the published cases control, observational studies and  randomized trials. The randomized trials and large observational studies showed a  mild increase risk in flares and thrombotic events, whereas retrospective studies  did not show increase in these risks but suggesting selection bias. A better  profile on the blood clotting parameters and surrogate markers of the arterial  risk can be obtained by transdermal estrogen and natural progesterone in non SLE  women. Less venous thrombotic events are observed in women at risk for thrombosis  with the transdermal estradiol administration in a case control study. However no  randomized trial is still available and no epidemiological data are reassuring on  the arterial risk. Prescription of HT has to remain especially prudent in women  with SLE. If a decision of treatment is taken transdermal estradiol and  progesterone or close pregnane derivatives should be probably most valuable but  also used at the minimal dose.

T1  - Treatment of lupus nephritis: facing the era of immunotherapy.
SP  - 235-45
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting over  half of SLE patients. The traditional treatment protocol with cyclophosphamide  and corticosteroids dramatically improved patient and renal survival, but  conferred a heavy burden of side effects. In addition, not all patients respond  to first-line immunosuppression; 35% suffer at least one episode of renal relapse  and 5-20% develop end-stage renal disease. Over the last decade, the increasing  understanding of the complex pathogenesis underlying lupus nephritis and  accelerating advances in molecular and cellular immunology have paved the way for  development of immunomodulatory therapies for LN. In contrast to the global  immunosuppressive effects of conventional treatment, these biologic agents target  specific pathways that contribute to the inflammatory response, aiming to reduce  tissue damage while preserving immunocompetence. The goal of this review is to  highlight some of the more promising novel immunomodulators, including Abetimus  sodium, Rituximab, Epratuzumab, Abatacept, Belimumab, Tocilizumab and Infliximab,  and discuss how these agents affect central pathways in the pathogenesis of  disease.

Prognosis of SLE pregnancy has  dramatically improved with the advent in therapeutic management of SLE and in the  obstetric care. Consequently, pregnancy is possible in SLE patients when the  disease is inactive for at least 6 months. Because of the risk of lupus flare and  obstetrical complications (fetal loss, preterm birth, intrauterine growth  retardation, preeclampsia), a multidisciplinary approach, associating medical and  obstetrical teams, is required. Corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and  azathioprine are safe in pregnancy and should be kept when necessary.

T1  - Pregnancy in women with renal disease. Part II: specific underlying renal 
SP  - 399-405
AB  - The obstetric outcome in women with kidney disease has improved in recent years  due to continuous progress in obstetrics and neonatology, as well as better  medical management of hypertension and renal disease. However, every pregnancy in  these women remains a high-risk pregnancy. When considering the interaction  between renal disease and pregnancy, maternal outcomes are related to the initial  level of renal dysfunction more than to the specific underlying disease. With  regards to fetal outcomes, though, a distinction may exist between renal  dysfunction resulting from primary renal disease and that in which renal  involvement is part of a systemic disease. In part II of this review, some  specific causes of renal failure affecting pregnancy are considered.

T1  - Morbidity and mortality in the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome: 
SP  - 290-4
AB  - The catastrophic variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a condition  characterized by multiple vascular occlusive events, usually affecting small  vessels and evolving over a short period of time, together with laboratory  confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The pathogenesis of  catastrophic APS is not completely understood. The mortality rate was ~50% in the  earliest published series, but recently it has clearly fallen by some 20% due to  the use, as first-line therapies, of full anticoagulation, corticosteroids,  plasma exchanges, and intravenous immunoglobulins. Cerebral involvement has been  identified as the main cause of death, being present in one third of patients,  and consisting mainly of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage and encephalopathy, followed  by cardiac involvement and infection. The only identified prognostic factor for a  higher mortality rate is the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - Lupus and the antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy and obstetrics: clinical 
SP  - 267-73
AB  - The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in pregnancy is associated with repeated  miscarriages and fetal loss. Other complications of pregnancy such as  preeclampsia and placental insufficiency are also frequently reported during  pregnancy in APS. The pathogenesis of pregnancy failures in APS is related to  both the thrombophilic effect of antiphospholipid antibodies and also to  different mechanisms including a direct effect of antibodies on trophoblast  differentiation and invasion. Although optimal pharmacologic treatment is  essential to achieve a successful outcome in APS pregnancy, the standard APS  pharmacologic treatment alone may not be sufficient. A good obstetric outcome is  the result of careful obstetric monitoring, proper delivery timing, and skillful  neonatal care. A multidisciplinary team (obstetricians, rheumatologists, and  neonatologists) and the progress in neonatal intensive care are as important as  drugs in achieving a good obstetric outcome and to reduce the possible  consequences of premature delivery.

T1  - Psychosis due to systemic lupus erythematosus: characteristics and long-term 
SP  - 1498-502
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, characteristics and long-term outcome of  psychosis due to SLE defined according to the ACR nomenclature for  neuropsychiatric (NP) syndromes. METHODS: All the patients who strictly fulfilled  the ACR definition for psychosis due to lupus were identified within the 485  patients of our lupus cohort and retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Psychosis  due to lupus was diagnosed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Lupus psychosis presented as  the initial presentation of SLE in 60% of the patients and within the first year  of the disease in 80% of the cases. All the patients developed psychotic symptoms  within the context of multi-systemic lupus activity, with 90% of them having  cutaneous involvement. Psychosis activity in our patients was associated with  biological markers of lupus activity in 90% of the cases. The aPLS were observed  in 10% of the cases. Seventy percent of our patients showed complete resolution  of psychotic symptoms after a mean follow-up of 155 months. Long-lasting  remissions were seen in all those patients. Chronic mild psychotic symptoms were  observed in 30% of our patients. CONCLUSION: Psychosis due to lupus is an  uncommon event that usually occurs early in the course of the disease and is  associated with other clinical and biological features of SLE. Long-term outcome  appears to be favourable after intensive immunosuppressive treatment. This report  highlights the need for prospective multi-centre studies to improve our knowledge  and to help establish guidelines for the treatment of this rare complication of  lupus.

T1  - Inflammatory lipids as a target for therapy in the rheumatic diseases.
SP  - 1213-24
AB  - As patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases live longer due to improved  therapies and preventive measures, death and disability from cardiovascular  events are increasing. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus  erythematosus have an increased risk of atherosclerosis that persists even after  accounting for traditional cardiac risk factors. Recent studies strongly suggest  that the mechanism is due in part to increased levels of oxidized lipids (such as  oxidized low density lipoprotein and pro-inflammatory high density lipoproteins)  which cause the inflammatory cascade that ultimately leads to plaque formation.  The objective of this review is to discuss how inflammatory lipids contribute to  the increased risk of atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus  erythematosus, as well as to propose that these oxidized lipids are a rational  target for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune diseases. Published literature  was examined to review treatments for pro-inflammatory lipids in autoimmune  diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In  conclusion, it is possible that these oxidized lipids may also contribute to  increased disease manifestations in rheumatic conditions. Several new and  existing therapies, including statins and high density lipoprotein-associated  protein peptide mimetics such as D-4F (apoA-1) target these oxidized lipids and  may be useful in both preventing atherosclerosis and treating inflammation in  patients with rheumatic diseases.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus-associated optic neuritis: clinical experience and 
SP  - 204-10
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the visual outcome of optic neuritis in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A retrospective,  case-observational study was conducted by reviewing eight patients with  SLE-associated optic neuritis from January 1986 to October 2004. The demographic  data, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, medical management and disease  courses of these eight patients were retrospectively analysed. Main outcome  measurements included final visual acuity (VA) and relapse of optic neuritis.  Statistical analyses were made using the chi-square test and a linear regression  model. The English-language literature on SLE-associated optic neuritis was  reviewed. RESULTS: Initial visual loss was severe in SLE-associated optic  neuritis. Seven patients (87%) had VA < 20/200 at onset. All patients received  steroid pulse therapy followed by oral steroid tapering. Final visual outcome was  highly variable, ranging from the complete recovery of VA in four patients, to  partial recovery in one and poor recovery in three. Better visual recovery  occurred in patients who received earlier treatment (within 10 days). However,  longer duration of steroid administration was found to have no significant  benefit on visual outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic lupus erythematosus-associated  optic neuritis is not common. However, it is important that ophthalmologists  differentiate SLE-associated optic neuritis from idiopathic optic neuritis  because of the severe visual impairment and steroid dependence associated with  the former. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important for restoring  visual function in these patients.

T1  - Systemic diseases with renal manifestations.
SP  - 297-328, vi-vii
AB  - This article discusses the epidemiology, recognition, screening, and management  of six systemic diseases that commonly present with renal manifestations:  diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis, congestive heart failure, HIV, liver  disease, and dysproteinemias. Diabetic nephropathy remains the leading cause of  end-stage renal disease in the United States. The outlook for patients who have  lupus nephritis and HIV-associated nephropathy has improved in the last decade.  Kidney disease is common in patients who have advanced liver disease, and  creatinine-based methods do not provide an accurate estimation of renal function  in this population. Dysproteinemias are associated with protean renal  manifestations, and renal disease may be the presenting manifestation.

T1  - Anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody treatment in inflammatory autoimmune 
SP  - 193-200
AB  - Tocilizumab (namely MRA), a humanized anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor monoclonal  antibody, is under development by Roche for the treatment of inflammatory  autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic onset juvenile  idiopathic arthritis (JIA), adult-onset Still's disease, Castleman's disease and  Crohn's disease. Tocilizumab has a long plasma half-life, so it can be  administered intravenously biweekly or monthly. Phase I and II clinical trials  showed that tocilizumab (2, 4, 5, 8 or 10 mg/kg) reduced disease activity  significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Tocilizumab not only improved signs and  symptoms, but also normalized inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein,  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen and serum amyloid A, and  reversed joint damage of RA. The efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of RA  was at least as good as methotrexate. Tocilizumab was generally safe and well  tolerated. Some adverse events such as significant rises in total cholesterol and  triglyceride levels, liver function disorders, decreases in white blood cell  counts, diarrhoea and infection were observed. In summary, preliminary clinical  results suggest that tocilizumab is effective and generally well tolerated in the  treatment of IL-6-related inflammatory autoimmune diseases. Like other  anti-cytokine immunotherapies, caution and close monitoring for the adverse  events, especially infection, are necessary in subsequent clinical trials.

SP  - 477-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess available evidence on the use of end-points (outcome  measures) in clinical trials in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as a part of  the development of evidence-based recommendations for points to consider in  clinical trials in SLE. METHODS: The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)  Task Force on SLE comprised 19 specialists, a clinical epidemiologist and a  research fellow. Key questions addressing the evidence for clinical trial  end-points in SLE were compiled using the Delphi technique. A systematic search  of the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases was performed using McMaster/Hedges  clinical query strategies and an array of relevant terms. Evidence was  categorised based on sample size and type of design, and the categories of  available evidence were identified for each recommendation. The strength of  recommendation was assessed based on the category of available evidence and  agreement on the statements was measured across the 19 specialists. RESULTS:  Eight questions were generated regarding end-points for clinical trials. The  evidence to support each proposition was evaluated. The literature review  revealed that most outcome measures used in phase 2/3 trials in SLE have not been  formally validated in clinical trials, although some indirect validation has been  undertaken. CONCLUSION: This systematic literature review forms the evidence base  considered in the development of the EULAR recommendations for end-points in  clinical trials in SLE.

T1  - [CCL2/MCP1: a novel target in systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis].
SP  - 220-4
AB  - Cytokine blockade, a valid therapeutic concept, is not established in lupus  nephritis as yet. In lupus nephritis CCL2/MCP-1 and its chemokine receptor CCR2  are of interest because CCL2/CCR2 mediate the recruitment of macrophages and T  cells in the nephritic kidney. Lupus nephritis is markedly attenuated in CCL2- or  CCR2-deficient autoimmune mice. Epidemiological studies addressing mutations in  the CCL2 gene support the hypothesis that CCL2 mediates renal inflammation.  Meanwhile experimental studies have shown that several classes of CCL2  antagonists can control established lupus nephritis. Interestingly, therapeutic  CCL2 blockade does not affect the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and the  production of lupus autoantibodies. This article briefly summarizes the potential  role of therapeutic CCL2 blockade in lupus nephritis.

T1  - Lupus: improving long-term prognosis.
SP  - 166-70
AB  - Over recent decades short patients affected with systemic lupus erythematosus, but long-term prognosis  still remains poor mainly due to complications of the disease and/or its  treatment. To improve long-term prognosis in systemic lupus erythematosus, we  should try to adopt, early in the disease course, strategies that can contribute  to reducing long-term complications, including screening for and prophylaxis  against infections, control of risk factors for atherosclerosis, and cancer  surveillance. However, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus all these  preventive strategies are often not sufficient. Indeed, two important systemic  lupus erythematosus-related factors play a relevant role in all these  complications: severe disease manifestations, such as glomerulonephritis and  central nervous system involvement, and corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide use.  Therefore, to prevent long-term complications, we should try to control disease  activity and severity using the lowest effective dosage of these drugs. Moreover,  strategies directed at preventing clinical manifestations in asymptomatic  antinuclear antibody-positive individuals or in antiphospholipid  antibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus patients, as well as at preventing  severe manifestations in patients with mild systemic lupus erythematosus at the  time of the diagnosis should be considered.

T1  - Cytokines and their receptors as biomarkers of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 189-98
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is the most clinically diverse autoimmune disease.  Owing to its heterogeneous presentation, clinical management of systemic lupus  erythematosus remains as one of the greatest challenges. Therefore, there is a  great need to assess disease activity accurately. Biomarkers can be objectively  measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic  processes or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention, and may also  predict the risk of the disease, confirm diagnosis, monitor disease activity and  provide prognostic information. Cytokines play an important and diverse role in  the immune dysregulation in systemic lupus erythematosus. Measuring serum levels  of soluble IL-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-10, soluble TNF receptor and  IFN-alpha/IFN-induced genes may be promising biomarkers of disease activity in  systemic lupus erythematosus.

AB  - A 20-year-old woman, with systemic lupus erythmatosus complicated by steroid-and  immunosuppressant-resistant bilateral pleural effusion, was admitted to the  emergency room because of dyspnea and fever. Chest Xray film revealed bilateral  massive pleural effusion. Bilateral thoracocentesis yielded fluid with chyle.  Conservative treatment including intravenous hyper-alimentation and continuous  drainage were performed but with no remarkable improvement. She underwent  thoracoscopy-aided ligation of the thoracic duct. After the operation, bilateral  pleurodesis was performed by intrathoracic injection of OK-432, because of  uncontrolled pleural effusion. There have been no signs of recurrence at 10  months in this case of SLE with steroid-and immunosuppressant-resistant pleural  effusion.

SP  - 1371-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We present a case of systemic lupus erythematosus with symptomatic  sensorineural hearing loss which was successfully treated with azathioprine, as  assessed both clinically and radiologically. We also present a review of the  relevant literature. CASE REPORT: A woman with systemic lupus erythematosus  presented with sensorineural hearing loss, initially on the right and  subsequently developing on the left over several months. An audiogram revealed  profound neurosensory hearing loss bilaterally. The patient was treated with  prednisone 60 mg daily and azathioprine 200 mg daily. An improvement on the left  was noted on follow-up audiography as well as on magnetic resonance imaging of  the internal auditory canals and surrounding structures. CONCLUSION:  Sensorineural hearing loss has been described in autoimmune disorders but is  rare. Aural symptoms have been described, with varying incidences (0-57.5 per  cent), in systemic lupus erythematosus. However, symptomatic sensorineural  hearing loss is rare in systemic lupus erythematosus. Prednisone appears  essential when an immunological or vasculitic cause is found. The use of  azathioprine should be considered, as well as follow-up with magnetic resonance  imaging to detect improvement.

SP  - 156-61
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the results of the current therapy of lupus  nephritis, highlighting successes and pitfalls, and summarizing the evidence  available on the new agents RECENT FINDINGS: The established treatment of lupus  nephritis with aggressive immunosuppression, based on cyclophosphamide and  steroids, has improved the outcome of lupus nephritis, but is burdened with  significant adverse effects. The search for alternative, less toxic, therapeutic  strategies has prompted a number of clinical studies, mycophenolate mofetil being  the agent most studied. Results of trials showed that this drug is equally  effective with fewer toxic complications than standard therapy, but its long-term  efficacy is not yet known. During the last few years experimental studies in the  pathogenesis of lupus nephritis have provided an enormous improvement in our  knowledge and have offered the possibility to attempt targeting the disease with  a more selective approach. The evidence for the role of these new therapies is  reviewed. SUMMARY: While the current alternative to standard therapy, i.e.  mycophenolate mofetil, still needs to be confirmed with well designed, properly  powered studies, new therapeutic agents, targeted to the pathogenetic mechanism  of the disease, are promising improved efficacy with less toxicity.

T1  - B-cell depletion and repopulation in autoimmune diseases.
SP  - 50-5
AB  - Although T-lymphocytes have long been regarded as the prime effector of  autoimmune diseases, numerous studies have since highlighted a key role for  B-lymphocytes. For example, disturbances in the distribution of circulating  B-cell subsets were reported in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) and systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE). Consequently, this was the rationale to treat such  patients for B-cell depletion with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab). The  aim of this review is to describe and analyze the B-cell subset distribution at  baseline and after rituximab therapy in patients with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis,  and pSS. Finally, we will compare factors that may interfere with  anti-CD20-mediated B-cell depletion in these autoimmune diseases.

T1  - B cell-directed therapies for autoimmune disease and correlates of disease 
SP  - 13-21; quiz 22-3
AB  - Recent advances have led to the development of mAbs that effectively deplete B  cells in human beings and target pathways essential for B-cell development. B  cell-directed therapies represent promising treatments for autoimmune disorders,  although many questions remain about their optimal use in the clinic.  Autoantibody depletion correlates with the clinical effectiveness of these drugs  in some diseases but not all. This finding implies that self-reactive B cells are  playing important pathogenic roles in autoimmune disorders beyond the production  of autoantibodies. Clinical studies of B cell-directed therapies are beginning to  illuminate the effects of B-cell modulation on immune function using a variety of  mechanistic approaches, including delineation of B-cell subsets by flow  cytometry, measurement of serum autoantibodies and cytokines, and tests of  immunocompetence. Recent clinical studies have been performed in patients with  rheumatoid arthritis and SLE suggesting the depletion of memory cells accounts at  least in part for the clinical efficacy of rituximab therapy, but these findings,  although provocative, require further investigation in larger cohorts. Memory B  cells are not the only targets of depleting antibodies; therefore, other B-cell  populations of therapeutic relevance may be modulated by these interventions.  Moreover, pathologic B-cell responses may be favorably influenced by other  targeted approaches such as those using anti-B-cell activating factor belonging  to the TNF family (BAFF) or anti-CD22 antibodies.

T1  - Preventive strategies in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 192-7
AB  - Despite the improvement of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) survival observed  in the last decades, the long-term prognosis of these patients remains poor  mainly due to complications of the disease and/or of its treatment. Therefore, in  order to improve SLE prognosis, we should try to avoid long-term complications by  adopting, early in the disease course, some strategies directed to prevent  infections, atherosclerosis and cancer. Moreover, since it has been shown that  autoantibodies appear before clinical manifestations in SLE, the question of  whether or not asymptomatic individuals with a reliable positive serology should  be treated arises. Other than advising these individuals to avoid sun exposure,  drugs implicated in drug-induced lupus and cigarette smoking, the use of vitamin  D and hydroxychloroquine could be considered. Finally, early SLE diagnosis has  led to a modification of disease clinical spectrum at disease onset with an  increased frequency of mild disease manifestations over severe ones. Thus great  effort should be made in order to identify early in the disease course risk  factors for the development of severe SLE manifestations. Finally patients with  mild disease carrying factors predictive of severe manifestations should be  treated more aggressively than we have done up to now.

Specifically, the discussion characterizes the role of sex hormones in the immune  response and a female predilection for the common diseases seen in daily practice  (ie, lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and other autoimmune diseases). A  comparison between the sexes, with respect to autoimmune disease mechanisms, is  presented to give oral and maxillofacial surgeons a better insight as to the role  of sex and successful surgical treatment outcomes in this population of patients.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric lupus and reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome: a 
SP  - 256-62
AB  - Reversible posterior leucoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) has been increasingly  recognized and reported in the literature. While the condition has been well  described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia,  post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in  patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is  likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to  distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related  complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and  differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical  presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and  subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment  such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with  RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the  brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic  derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and  aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful  management of RPLS. Such treatment strategy ensures a very high chance of total  neurological recovery in lupus patients with RPLS.

T1  - Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus 
SP  - 163-81
AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are both chronic  autoimmune rheumatic diseases. In the last few years, evolution in the  understanding of RA and SLE pathogenesis and underlying molecular mechanisms has  resulted in development and availability of novel therapies. In particular, the  recent acknowledgement of a more significant role for B cells in the pathogenesis  of RA, in contrast to the view that it was predominantly a T cell disorder,  provided rationale for trials of B cell depletion therapy with the chimeric  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. The efficacy and favourable safety  profile of rituximab have resulted in the recent approval by the European  Medicines Agency for its usage in patients with RA unresponsive to conventional  therapies. The salient features from the pivotal open and randomised controlled  trials are reviewed in this chapter. Given the recognition of B cell dysfunction  as central to SLE pathogenesis, the use of anti-CD20 antibody therapy for this  patient group has also been established. Results of the open trials have been  encouraging, particularly in patients not responding to usual therapies, and a  randomised controlled trial is underway.

T1  - [Statins--are they potentially useful in rheumatology?].
SP  - 420-5
AB  - For more than 30 years statins have been successfully used in patients with  hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, there is a growing  body of evidence, that statins exert effects by much exceeding the effect of  cholesterol level decrease. Inhibition of earlier stages of cholesterol  biosynthesis pathway (not influencing the very cholesterol level) results in  blocking the intermediate metabolite synthesis; isoprenoids (farnesyl phosphate  and geranyl phosphate), which play a regulatory function in cells. Statins have  antiatherosclerotic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and  antithrombotic effects. It applies equally to diseases of chronic inflammation  type, as to those, where bone metabolism is disturbed. It is well known that  statins decrease bone fracture risk; through bone formation intensification, and  inhibition of bone tissue resorption. Slowing down the atherosclerosis  progression is a very important effect, considering that in rheumatoid arthritis  (RA) and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) we are dealing with premature and  rapid progression of atherosclerotic lesions. In this paper statins pathways of  action in rheumatic diseases (including pleiotropic effects), and their potential  use in rheumatology have been discussed. Though there is lack of reliable data  enabling statins introduction to standard complementary therapy in rheumatic  diseases, the results however of completed studies allow concluding of their  utility. The statins that were most frequently evaluated in clinical studies were  simvastatin and atorvastatin. Studies on statins have been performed in RA, SLE,  osteoporosis and systemic vasculotos.

T1  - Disease-specific quality indicators, guidelines, and outcome measures in systemic 
SP  - 107-13
AB  - The assessment of quality of care is becoming increasingly important, but as yet  no standard set of measures to assess quality has been developed. The ACR Quality  Measures Committee has selected the following areas of study to develop quality  indicators: diagnostic/classification criteria, outcome measures/response  criteria, treatment guidelines/management recommendations, definition of quality  indicators, and definition of data collection systems. The aim of the present  review is to evaluate existing guidelines and outcome measures concerning  disease/activity monitoring, autoantibody and laboratory assessment, outcomes,  and therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that could be used to define  disease-specific quality indicators. Much data is available in the literature  that could serve to define a starter set of quality indicators for SLE.  Monitoring issues are discussed in the ACR and EULAR recommendations. As far as  therapy is concerned, the ACR has provided indicators for rheumatoid arthritis  that could also be applied to SLE, as well as indications for anti-malarial  monitoring. The outcomes measures most frequently used in SLE are damage and  death, but organ-specific definitions of outcome and response are being  evaluated. The development of quality measures for SLE is just beginning;  existing information could serve to construct a starter set of indicators such as  the one proposed here. Certainly much progress will be made in the near future. A  practical, user-friendly tool for physicians that will help them deliver high  quality care to populations is also needed.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus: a review for dentists.
SP  - 823-8
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease with far-reaching  systemic implications. The hallmark feature in SLE is chronic inflammation. It  can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, nervous system, serous membranes  such as the pleura and pericardium, mucous membranes and other organs of the  body. It is imperative that the dental practitioner be familiar with the broad  range of systemic and oral implications, including the clinical and biochemical  features of SLE. This review article offers an overview of the multiple organ  systems affected by this complex heterogeneous disease process that are most  relevant to both the general practitioner and the dental specialist. In  particular, ways to recognize and manage the oral and dental manifestations of  this systemic illness are presented.

T1  - Disease activity assessment in SLE: do we have the right instruments?
SP  - iii61-4
AB  - No new therapy has been approved for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in  decades. Interest in SLE by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies has  increased, leading to multiple clinical trials. Unfortunately, we have now  compiled quite a long list of "failed" trials. If this was due to the fact that  the studied therapy did not work in SLE, we could accept it and move on. Of  concern, however, is that many of the "failed" treatments had a strong "signal"  of efficacy, often in subgroup analyses that made logical sense, given what was  known about the mechanism of action of the treatment. This has led,  understandably, to concern that there is something wrong with SLE trial designs,  particularly with SLE disease activity indices.

T1  - Emerging biological therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 167-71
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic inflammatory autoimmune  disorder characterized by multisystem involvement and fluctuating disease  activity. Symptoms range from rather mild manifestations such as rash or  arthritis to life-threatening end-organ manifestations such as glomerulonephritis  or thrombosis. Virtually every organ system is subject to potential damage.  Symptoms typically wax and wane over the course of the disease; yet  unfortunately, many patients will experience a slow decline in their health  because of the ongoing systemic inflammation. Effective treatment must be  individualized and is often based on the specific manifestations that are seen in  each patient. In a similar manner, prognosis is also dependent on the severity  and the specific organ systems involved.

T1  - The chemokine network in systemic lupus erythematous nephritis.
SP  - 904-22
AB  - In response to renal immune complex accumulation in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), monocytes, T lymphocytes, and neutrophils infiltrate the kidney and  mediate tissue injury and renal dysfunction. Chemotactic factors induced by  immune complexes are responsible for recruiting these inflammatory cells to the  kidney. Considerable attention has focused on the role of the chemokine network  in regulating renal leukocyte recruitment in autoimmune glomerular diseases. In  animal models of SLE nephritis, intervention studies directed at chemokines or  chemokine receptors have provided definitive proof that specific chemokines are  involved in the pathogenesis of renal inflammation. These same chemokines and  chemokine receptors are expressed in the kidney during human SLE nephritis, and  correlate with markers of renal injury and inflammation. This review will  describe and integrate the animal and human data to build a case for targeting  the chemokine network as a novel approach to the treatment of SLE nephritis.  Anti-chemokine therapies hold the promise of efficacy with fewer adverse  side-effects than the non-specific immunosuppression regimens currently in use.

T1  - Total hip arthroplasty in secondary systemic lupus erythematosus femoral head 
SP  - 123-9
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disease with a large spectrum of  clinical manifestations and a variable course. Lupus is marked by both humoral  and cellular immunologic abnormalities, including multiple auto-antibodies  especially anti DNA antibodies. Epidemiology - female predominance, occurring  usually between second and fourth decade of life, more frequently in hispanic and  black patients. Family predominance has been noticed. Provocative agents -  ultraviolet light, viral infections, drugs and situational stresses. Pathogenesis  - pathological features can affect a large spectrum of internal organs and  systems - osteoarticulary injuries, skin rash, lymphadenopathy,  glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, digestive system lesions. Musculo skeletal  abnormalities include migratory arthritis, effusion and stiffness in small and  large joints. Articular erosions are uncommon. Skeletal abnormalities include  osteopenia and osteonecrosis, due to two pathological mechanisms: vasculitis and  long term corticotherapy. Fifteen to twenty percent of SLE patients are affected  by femoral head avascular necrosis (FHAN). Diagnosis rests on clinical signs -  hip pain, limited range of motion, walking with a limp.; radiological findings -  best grouped in Arlet-Ficat standing system; MRI - high sensitivity, especially  in infraradiological stages. Treatment - in incipient stages core decompression  represents the best therapeutical option. In advanced, arthritis stages, total  hip arthroplasty (THA) is the standart treatment. Three implant types are  available: bipolar, uncemented and cemented. An increased number of cotyloidites  occurred after bipolar implants. Emphasised osteopenia and excessive bleeding  represent contraindications for uncemented implants. Considering all of this,  cemented implants are considered, the right choice, methacrylate cement providing  strong and durable fixation of THA implants to bone. No meaningful differences  were observed in postoperative functional recovery between LSE patients and other  etiology FHAN patients.

T1  - Autologous stem cell transplantation in autoimmune diseases.
SP  - 278-85
AB  - Since 1996, approximately 1,000 patients have received an autologous  hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) as treatment for a severe autoimmune  disease (AD). The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation  (EBMT)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Autoimmune Disease Working  Party have registered more than 800 patients and works in close collaboration  with networks in the United States where several hundred more AD patients have  been similarly transplanted. The majority of ADs were multiple sclerosis (MS),  systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid  arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and immune cytopenias. Many  patients have experienced long-term disease-free remissions and immune  reconstitution studies have shown in some cases that a "resetting" of  autoimmunity is possible. The initially high treatment-related mortality (TRM) is  reduced significantly in the later years, and the phase I/II experience is now  being verified in several international prospective randomized clinical trials.  In addition, the past several years have seen a growing interest in the role and  potential therapeutic application of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the  immunomodulation of AD, as in the early experience with acute-graft-versus host  disease (GvHD).

T1  - The potential utility of B cell-directed biologic therapy in autoimmune diseases.
SP  - 205-15
AB  - Increasing awareness of the importance of aberrant B cell regulation in  autoimmunity has driven the clinical development of novel B cell-directed  biologic therapies with the potential to treat a range of autoimmune disorders.  The first of these drugs-rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the B  cell-specific surface marker CD20-was recently approved for treating rheumatoid  arthritis in patients with an inadequate response to other biologic therapies.  The aim of this review is to discuss the potential use of rituximab in the  management of other autoimmune disorders. Results from early phase clinical  trials indicate that rituximab may provide clinical benefit in systemic lupus  erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, vasculitis, and thrombocytopenic purpura.  Numerous case reports and several small pilot studies have also been published  reporting the use of rituximab in conditions such as myositis, antiphospholipid  syndrome, Still's disease, and multiple sclerosis. In general, the results from  these preliminary studies encourage further testing of rituximab therapy in  formalized clinical trials. Based on results published to date, it is concluded  that rituximab, together with other B cell-directed therapies currently under  clinical development, is likely to provide an important new treatment option for  a number of these difficult-to-treat autoimmune disorders.

T1  - The impact of autoimmune disorders and adverse pregnancy outcome.
SP  - 223-6
AB  - Autoimmune diseases are a group of heterogeneous disorders equally characterized  by the same pathogenetic mechanism: an immunological reaction against self  antigens promoted by antibodies, immuno-complex formation, and self-reactive T  lymphocytes. Autoimmune diseases may be separated into organ-restricted diseases  and systemic ones. The damage of single organs produced by antibodies focused  against specific cellular antigens characterizes the first group of diseases,  whereas the latter are produced by a systemic inflammatory process initiated by  inappropriate and excess immune activation that leads to immuno-complex formation  and deposition onto sensitive tissues. Since connective and vascular tissue are  principally damaged in these disorders, systemic autoimmune diseases are more  commonly known as "connective tissue diseases" (CTD) and include: systemic lupus  erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren syndrome, and  others. Although they are considered as different from a pathogenetic point of  view, they overlap in many aspects, such as general symptoms as fever and  fatigue, chronical ongoing, steroid therapy. As patients suffering from CTD are  predominantly young women between the ages of 20 and 40 years, which is the  period of the highest childbearing potential, particular interest must be  regarded to the impact that these diseases and their therapies have on pregnancy  and, conversely, the effect of pregnancy on these disorders, which may have  long-lasting implications for mothers and neonates. Adverse fetal outcomes,  maternal disease flares, and drug potential teratogenic risk are the main reasons  why women suffering from CTD and who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant  are considered a high-risk population. These patients require integrated,  interdisciplinary care, addressing every aspect of rheumatology, obstetrics, and  neonatology to reduce maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications.

AB  - In rheumatic diseases there can appear deteriorations of the thrombocytes number  in the sense of increase or decrease of this number.Thrombocytosis has 3 major  causes: (1) reactive or secondary thrombocytosis; (2) family thrombocytosis and  (3) clonal thrombocytosis. Thrombocytopenia, that is, decrease of the  thrombocytes number below 150000/mmc is unusually in rheumatic diseases. Their  mechanism of production can be central and peripheral. In the connective tissue  disorders and vasculitis thrombocytopenia can has different causes: (1) decrease  thrombocytes production; (2) splenic platelets sequestration; (3) peripheral  platelets consumption; (4) peripheral immune mediated destruction of platelets.  Thrombocytopenia is present in the following rheumatic diseases: systemic lupus  erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, Felty syndrome,  vasculitis. Steroids are the conventional first line therapy for immune  thrombocytopenia. Corticosteroid resistance can develop as a result of  deteriorations that appear to the any level of pathway action of corticosteroids.

AB  - In this review we describe an international project, conducted by the Paediatric  Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) that was aimed to  identify, validate and promulgate core sets of measures and a definition of  improvement for the evaluation of response to therapy in clinical trials and in  daily clinical practice in patients with juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus  (JSLE). The following clinical measures were included in the PRINTO core set of  outcome measure for the evaluation of response to therapy: 1) physician's global  assessment of disease activity; 2) global disease activity measure; 3) 24-hour  proteinuria; 4) parent's global assessment of the overall patient's well-being;  5) health-related quality of life assessment. The measures included in the core  set were found to be feasible and not redundant, to have good construct validity,  discriminative ability, internal consistency, with fair responsiveness to  clinically important change in disease activity, and to be associated strongly  with treatment outcome. In order to be classified as responder to a given  treatment, a patient should demonstrate at least 50% improvement from baseline in  any two of the five core set measures with no more than one of the remaining  worsening by more than 30%. This definition is now known as the 'PRINTO/American  College of Rheumatology (ACR) provisional criteria for JSLE'. The proposed core  set and definition of improvement incorporate clinically meaningful change in a  composite endpoint for the evaluation of global response to therapy in JSLE. The  definition is now proposed for use in JSLE clinical trials, and may help  physicians to decide if a child with SLE has responded adequately to therapy.

T1  - Current issues in pediatric lupus nephritis: role of revised histopathological 
SP  - 297-309
AB  - Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has an unpredictable natural  history with variable clinical manifestations. The prognosis of SLE is linked  closely to renal involvement with lupus nephritis (LN), which is more severe in  patients with childhood-onset compared with adult-onset disease. The  histopathological classification of LN facilitates treatment decisions,  protocols, and clinical research. After the World Health Organization and  modified WHO classifications of LN from 1974 to 1995, the International Society  of Nephrology and Renal Pathology Society Working Group revised the  histopathological classification of LN. The reclassification was published in  2004 after their consensus conference held at Columbia University in New York in  May 2002. The aims of the reclassification were to standardize definitions,  emphasize clinically relevant lesions, and encourage uniform and reproducible  reporting among centers. Although the revised classification is time-consuming,  it is important for future international collaboration on multicenter trials of  disease-modifying agents. The prognosis of SLE and LN is linked to the  histopathology of the renal lesion, but the clinical manifestations of LN,  including nephrotic syndrome and hypertension, cannot predict the degree of renal  involvement. However, we are many years away from completely understanding the  etiopathogenesis of LN and the predictive role of the revised histological  classification for direction of patient management.

SP  - 1757-62
AB  - Ocular manifestations of lupus are fairly common, may be the presenting feature  of the disease and can be sight-threatening. Almost any part of the eye and  visual pathway can be affected by inflammatory or thrombotic processes. Ocular  pain and visual impairment require urgent assessment by an ophthalmologist.  Infection should be excluded. Optic neuritis and ischaemic optic neuropathy may  be difficult to distinguish. Scleritis and severe retinopathy require systemic  immunosuppression but episcleritis, anterior uveitis and dry eyes can usually be  managed with local eye drops. Vaso-occlusive disease, particularly in the  presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, requires treatment with anticoagulation  and proliferative retinopathy is treated with laser therapy. Hydroxychloroquine  rarely causes ocular toxicity at doses under 6.5 mg/kg/day. When this has  occurred, it has been associated with more than 5 years of drug exposure.

SP  - 311-9
AB  - Intravenous high-dose immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is used in several  antibody-mediated diseases including Guillain-Barre syndrome, idiopathic  thrombocytopenic purpura, and autoimmune neuropathies. In the last decade,  numerous studies have evaluated the application of IVIG therapy in autoimmune  glomerulopathies such as lupus nephritis, membranous glomerulonephritis, and  transplant-related chronic nephropathy. These studies were conducted on small  numbers of patients and varied with respect to IVIG doses and duration of therapy  cycles. Furthermore, many of the patients included in the studies did not respond  to conventional therapies, were affected by complications, and had impaired renal  function. IVIG therapy was able to reduce proteinuria and inflammation and  improve renal function in some forms of glomerulonephritis, particularly  LES-related forms. IVIG therapy was also tested in patients awaiting kidney  transplantation and in patients affected by transplant-related chronic  nephropathy: in both groups the results were controversial. Seventy-eight cases  of IVIG-related nephrotoxicity have been reported in the literature. In most  cases the toxic effect was reversible and observed in patients with pre-existing  renal failure treated with IVIG formulations containing saccharose. IVIG could  have beneficial effects in many glomerulopathies. Nevertheless, further trials  are needed to clarify the potential and the limitations of this therapeutic  approach.

SP  - 51-4
AB  - It is well known that certain autoimmune disorders are associated with pregnancy  loss. Increased perinatal and maternal mortality as well as increased incidence  of disease deterioration during pregnancy are correlated to preconceptual disease  regulation, incidence of super-imposed gestosis and renal failure and, recently,  with some sorts of antiphospholipid antibodies. Indeed, investigators have  attempted to establish an association between recurrent pregnancy loss and the  presence of specific antibodies, irrespective of the presence of other clinical  signs or complications of collagenosis. The most serious appears to be the  presence of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant while the  significance of other autoantibodies that can be found appears to be much less  defined. In the present paper pregnancy complicated by various collagenoses and  therapeutic modalities are discussed.

SP  - 1290-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We postulate that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  having recurrent infections are more likely to have poorer disease outcome. The  aim of this study is to describe the pattern of infections and disease damage  that occurred in a cohort of patients with juvenile-onset SLE, and to find out  whether cumulative disease damage was associated with recurrent infections in  these patients. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed (1988-2004) the clinical  characteristics, infective complications, and disease damage as measured by the  Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of  Rheumatology (SLICC/ACR) Damage Index (SDI) in 47 juvenile-onset SLE patients.  Potential risk factors for disease damage were evaluated by univariate analysis  and logistic regression. The correlation between number of major infections and  disease damage was determined. RESULTS: Thirty-two (68.1%) patients had lupus  nephropathy and 16 patients (34%) had neuropsychiatric lupus. Sixty-one episodes  of major infections, defined as infections requiring more than 1 week of  antimicrobial agents, occurred in 27 patients (57.4%), and 18 patients (31.4%)  had recurrent major infections (>/= 2 episodes). Organ damage (SDI >/= 1) was  documented in 21 subjects (44.7%). By logistic regression, occurrence of major  infections (P < 0.001) was the only significant risk factor for disease damage.  There was a positive correlation between SDI score with the number of recurrent  major infections (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.50, P < 0.001).  CONCLUSION: Infections and disease damage are common co-morbidities in  juvenile-onset SLE. Recurrent infections could predict poorer disease outcome and  associated organ damage in SLE.

T1  - New insights into central nervous system lupus: a clinical perspective.
SP  - 116-24
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) experience a wide array of  neurologic (N) and psychiatric (P) events, some of which are directly  attributable to lupus. Regardless of attribution, NP events have a significant  impact on individual patient's health-related quality of life. Primary  immunopathogenic mechanisms of NP-SLE include vasculopathy, autoantibody  production, and intrathecal inflammatory mediators. The recently described  anti-NR2 glutamate receptor antibodies have been implicated in animal models of  neuronal injury, but their role in the pathogenesis of human NP-SLE is unclear.  The diagnosis of NP-SLE remains largely one of exclusion, although the detection  of select autoantibodies, CSF analysis, and appropriate use of neuroimaging and  neuropsychometric testing may provide support in the evaluation of individual  patients. Therapeutic options include symptomatic therapies, immunosuppression,  and anticoagulation.

AB  - Pregnancy in the lupus patient presents a unique clinical challenge. Pregnancy  may interact with lupus nephritis and adds preeclampsia to the differential  diagnosis of hypertension. Lupus may result in pregnancy loss, fetal growth  restriction, and prematurity. The obstetric management of these complex issues is  presented for the nonobstetrician.

AB  - Pregnancy in a woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be complicated  by both lupus activity and pregnancy mishaps. The majority of recent studies  found an increase in lupus activity during pregnancy, perhaps exacerbated by  hormonal shifts required to maintain pregnancy. Increased lupus activity, in  turn, prompts an elevated risk for poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth,  preterm birth, low birth weight, and preeclamspsia. Fortunately, the majority of  pregnancies in women with SLE are successful. However, the interaction between  pregnancy and SLE activity can lead to complications for both mother and baby.

AB  - There is no consensus on the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  much less pregnancy in SLE patients. However, several key issues in the  management of SLE in pregnancy are commonly faced by rheumatologists,  nephrologists, and obstetricians. These include the treatment of SLE activity in  pregnancy, the ascertainment of lupus nephritis, treatment of antiphospholipid  antibodies, treatment of hypertension, and laboratory monitoring. These key  issues will be examined in this chapter.

T1  - [Pregnancy associated with connective tissue disease].
SP  - 11-6
AB  - The majority of connective tissue diseases, with the exception of scleroderma  which is usually diagnosed past the age of 40 years, may affect women of  reproductive age. Questions concerning the impact of the connective tissue  disease upon pregnancy, interactions of pregnancy with the disease, and influence  of the disease on fetal development are not easily answered. However, our  knowledge on the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases and the mechanisms of  action of various antibodies is increasing, enabling improved disease control and  reduction of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Multicenter, prospective clinical  studies verified some unproven opinions about the adverse influence of pregnancy  on scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as about their  unavoidably fatal interactions with pregnancy. Careful pregnancy planning and  cooperation of the rheumatologist, obstetrician and neonatologist helps avoid  disease exacerbation and fetal misdevelopment. Acetylsalicylic acid and heparin  reduce the adverse effect of antiphospholipid antibodies. Still, miscarriage,  intrauterine fetal death, intrauterine growth retardation, and prematurity are  more often encountered in women with systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the  risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in these patients is gradually falling. Active  lupus nephritis, hypertension, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and  history of miscarriage are important risk factors. Pregnancy in women with  diffuse type of scleroderma is of worse prognosis, often resulting in prematurity  and low birthweight. Establishing the risk of immunosupressive and  anti-inflammatory therapies enables better treatment of connective tissue  diseases in pregnancy. Currently there is no doubt that pregnancy is  contraindicated only in a small group of high-risk patients with connective  tissue disease.

SP  - 150-7
AB  - A growing number of nursing subspecializations have been developed in recent  decades. Topics of concern are that care is not tailored to cope with the growing  number of patients with more than one chronic disease, there is an increase in  co-ordination problems in the care that is provided for this group of complex  patients, and the care for these complex patients is extremely fragmented. The  assessment of health risks resulting in co-ordinated care with effective  communication is vital for multimorbid patients. Our aim is to describe a  systematic approach (the INTERMED [IM] method) to identify complex patients who  are in need of integrated care and its applicability to the nursing process. We  demonstrate the ability of the IM method to quantify, weigh, and classify the  complexity of problems. The method is applied in Europe and will be started in  the USA in a pharmacy program. The IM is presented as a decision-support system  for multidisciplinary teams with nurse co-ordinators.

T1  - LJP-394 (abetimus sodium) in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 873-9
AB  - Renal disease is one of the most severe aspects of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), potentially leading to irreversible kidney failure. The standard of care  for severe lupus nephritis involves the use of high-dose corticosteroids,  cyclophosphamide and other immunosuppressive drugs. Although these drugs are  effective in controlling disease activity in the majority of patients, up to 25%  of patients treated with cyclophosphamide-based protocols develop renal  insufficiency and end-stage renal disease, and treatment discontinuation is  associated with the occurrence of flares. Furthermore, these therapies are  associated with a high incidence of short- and long-term side effects. LJP-394  (abetimus sodium) is an investigational agent specifically designed to decrease  anti-dsDNA antibody levels, and it is under development for the prevention of  nephritic flares in patients with SLE since the early 1990s. The drug has been  evaluated in 13 clinical trials that evaluated > 800 patients with SLE, over a  10-year time span. It is likely that LJP-394 might have a role in the prevention  of renal flares in SLE patients, and if the initial data is confirmed in an  ongoing trial, this drug could represent either a substitute for  immunosuppressive drugs or could allow a reduction of their dose, thereby  reducing the risks of short- and long-term side effects. This paper reviews the  principal aspects of chemistry, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of LJP-394,  and analyses studies on animal models and clinical studies conducted in the last  few years.

T1  - Mycophenolate mofetil in induction and maintenance therapy of severe lupus 
SP  - 1933-42
AB  - BACKGROUND: The outcomes of previous trials of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in  treating severe lupus nephritis (LN) are not in exact agreement. This  meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assesses the benefits and  harms of MMF in the induction and maintenance therapy of severe LN. METHODS: We  searched Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Collaboration Database for RCTs that  compared MMF with other immunorepressive regimens for treating lupus nephritis  and extracted data for remissions, side effects and prognosis in induction  therapy and prognosis and side effects in maintenance therapy, and we summarized  the combined results of the data of the RCTs as relative risk (RR). RESULTS: We  analysed five RCTs with 307 patients-four RCTS providing the data for comparing  MMF with cyclophosphamide (CYC) for induction therapy and two RCTs providing the  data for comparing MMF with azathioprine (AZA) for maintenance therapy of severe  LN. Overall, compared with CYC, induction therapy with MMF reduced the risk of  infection significantly (RR 0.65, P<0.001). It also significantly increased the  complete remission rate compared with intravenous CYC (RR 3.10, P=0.006).  Compared with intravenous CYC, induction therapy with MMF reduced the incidence  of leucopenia significantly (RR 0.66, P=0.04). The prognosis and other side  effects were not significantly different between MMF and CYC induction therapies.  There was no significant difference between the patients receiving MMF and those  receiving AZA for maintenance therapy in prognosis or the risks of amenorrhoea  and herpes zoster. CONCLUSIONS: MMF has higher efficacy in inducing remission in  severe LN than pulsed intravenous therapy with CYC. Induction therapy with MMF is  also associated with fewer side effects than induction therapy with CYC. Compared  with AZA, MMF also is an alternative for maintenance therapy of severe LN without  significant difference in the prognosis or risks of amenorrhoea and herpes  zoster.

T1  - Chronic kidney disease and pregnancy: maternal and fetal outcomes.
SP  - 132-45
AB  - Chronic kidney disease complicates an increasing number of pregnancies, and at  least 4% of childbearing-aged women are afflicted by this condition. Although  diabetic nephropathy is the most common type of chronic kidney disease found in  pregnant women, a variety of other primary and systemic kidney diseases also  commonly occur. In the setting of mild maternal primary chronic kidney disease  (serum creatinine <1.3 mg/dL) without poorly controlled hypertension, most  pregnancies result in live births and maternal kidney function is unaffected. In  cases of more moderate and severe maternal primary chronic kidney disease, the  incidence of fetal prematurity, low birth weight, and death increase  substantially, and the risk of accelerated irreversible decline in maternal  kidney function, proteinuria, and hypertensive complications rise dramatically.  In addition to kidney function, maternal hypertension and proteinuria portend  negative outcomes and are important factors to consider when risk stratifying for  fetal and maternal complications. In the setting of diabetic nephropathy and  lupus nephropathy, other systemic disease features such as disease activity, the  presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and glycemic control play important  roles in determining pregnancy outcomes. Concomitant with advances in obstetrical  management and kidney disease treatments, it appears that the historically dismal  maternal and fetal outcomes have greatly improved.

SP  - 725-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) often starts in women of fertile  age. Due to the unpredictable nature of the disease and the increased risk of the  disease flaring up during pregnancy, women with SLE have previously often been  advised to avoid pregnancy. This summary reviews current insights in pregnancy  management of women with SLE. METHOD: Search in the Medline database (period  1980-2005) using keywords: SLE, lupus nephritis, antiphospholipid antibody,  neonatal lupus and pregnancy. RESULTS: Previous studies of pregnant women with  SLE have had different designs, sample sizes, selections of patients, definitions  and measures of outcome. Women with previous pregnancy losses, an ongoing active  disease with nephritis or hypertension and positive antiphospholipid antibodies,  have an increased risk of pregnancy loss. The most favourable pregnancy outcomes  are achieved when conception takes place during a remission of the disease.  INTERPRETATION: There are few absolute contraindications for pregnancies in women  with SLE. Women with SLE may experience uncomplicated pregnancies, but they need  to plan their pregnancies as the risk for complications is increased. Best  results are achieved through the cooperation of rheumatologists, gynaecologists  and nephrologists. Glucocorticosteroids, hydroxychlorocine, azathioprine and  anticoagulation may be used during pregnancy.

T1  - Human clinical trials in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 115-27
AB  - Improved patient survival after treatment of lupus nephritis with  corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and renal replacement therapy allows greater  emphasis on long-term management issues. In particular, the recent focus has been  on therapies to treat nephritis with fewer adverse effects compared with  cyclophosphamide and immunosuppressive regimens. Issues complicating clinical  trial design in lupus nephritis have severely limited comparisons across trials.  These issues, including recognition and stratification of high-risk populations,  comparable remission and response criteria, and appropriate use and  interpretation of activity and damage indices have been the subject of much  discussion and emerging consensus. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been used in  the field of transplantation for more than 10 years. After initial anecdotal  reports describing the benefits of MMF in the treatment of lupus nephritis,  randomized controlled trials have established a role for MMF in the treatment of  lupus nephritis. A host of newer agents including rituximab, abatacept, and  monoclonal antibodies blocking costimulatory targets are in current clinical  trials for lupus nephritis. As long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis improve, the  toxicity of therapy and risk of relapse become increasingly important  determinants of the choice of therapeutic agents.

SP  - 808-13
AB  - Most autoimmune diseases occur more commonly in females and many of these young  women wish to become mothers. For pregnancy to proceed successfully  immunomodulation and physiological changes preparing the reproductive system need  to occur. Pregnancy occurring in a chronically ill mother who requires  medications in order to maintain her own health and who may have already incurred  significant organ pathology gives rise to several problems and so four questions  arise: 1) What will be the effect of the pregnancy on the underlying disease? 2)  What will be the effect of the disease on the outcome of pregnancy? 3) How to  manage the disease, just prior to, throughout and immediately after the  pregnancy? 4) The long term fetal and childhood effects of maternal disease and  its management. This paper reviews the current literature pertaining to these  questions in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other chronic  rheumatic and autoimmune diseases.

T1  - Impact of in utero environment on the offspring of lupus patients.
SP  - 801-7
AB  - The number of patients affected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that decide  to have children has greatly increased probably because of recent improvements in  the diagnosis and management of the disease. This has stimulated our interest in  defining the outcome of children, focusing both on neonatal problems and long  term development. SLE patients still carry a risk of pregnancy loss. However, due  to careful monitoring and treatment by a multidisciplinary team, the number of  losses has dramatically decreased, but an increased number of preterm deliveries  is still a problem. Neonatal lupus is linked to the presence of anti-Ro/SS-A and  anti-La/SS-B antibodies in the mother, although other factors probably of fetal  origin are important. Neonatal lupus is a complex condition whose most serious  manifestation is the congenital heart block (CHB). Usually, children with  complete CHB need permanent pacing, but apparently do not have neuropsychological  problems. Studies focusing on the neuropsychological development of SLE offspring  show an increased number of learning disabilities in children with normal  intelligence levels. Fetal consequence of maternal treatment need to be  considered choosing non teratogenic drugs, but the withdrawal of medications just  because the patient is pregnant should be avoided to avoid SLE flares.

T1  - Immunizing patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a review of effectiveness 
SP  - 778-83
AB  - Concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of immunization in patients with SLE  have persisted for over 60 years, despite the increased risk of infection in  these patients. There are many anecdotal case reports of SLE induction or  exacerbation following immunization, but overall, these events seem to be very  rare. Evidence from prospective trials suggests that inactivated and component  vaccines are probably safe in patients with SLE. Live vaccines are  contraindicated in patients on immunosuppressive agents or high dose steroids  (prednisone 20 mg/day or greater). There is limited evidence regarding efficacy  of vaccination in patients with SLE. Studies assessing serological response to  vaccination have generally shown that the majority of patients have an  appropriate response, but a significant minority do not. Response to hepatitis B  vaccination may be impaired and serological responses should be assessed post  vaccination. It is not clear if disease activity or immunosuppressive medications  are risk factors for a poor response, rather than intrinsic abnormalities of  immune function in patients with SLE. The majority of patients appear to have a  reasonable serological response to vaccination.

T1  - Ethnic and geographical differences in systemic lupus erythematosus: an overview.
SP  - 715-9
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the most heterogeneous autoimmune  disorders known. There is production of a variety of autoantibodies and patients  present with a wide range of symptoms due to multiple organ involvement by the  disease process. The underlying cause is not fully understood but it may involve  genetic and environmental factors. It is interesting to note that while SLE is  found worldwide, it is more commonly found in some countries, and within a  country certain ethnic groups appear to be more susceptible to develop this  condition than others. Additionally, the presentation and course of SLE appear  highly variable between patients of different ethnic origins. For example,  African-Americans and Orientals are believed to have a more severe disease than  Caucasian whites. But are these ethnic and geographical differences real? If yes,  they may provide investigators insight into the underlying pathoaetiology of this  condition and pave the way to future research directions in lupus.

AB  - In order to know the causes of death and the prognostic factors, our group  analyzed 250 patients included until February 2005 in the web-site based  international registry of patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome  (APS) ("CAPS Registry") (http://www.med.ub.es/MIMMUN/FORUM/CAPS.HTM). Cerebral  involvement, mainly consisting of stroke, followed by cardiac involvement and  infections were considered the main causes of death in patients with catastrophic  APS. The presence of systemic lupus erythematosus was related with higher  mortality. According to the results of this analysis, anticoagulation plus  steroids plus plasma exchange should be the first line of therapy in patients  with catastrophic APS.

T1  - Targeting of B cells in SLE: rationale and therapeutic opportunities.
SP  - 51-6
AB  - B cells were first implicated in lupus pathogenesis because of their roles as  autoantibody producers. B cells, which play important roles in (auto)immune  recognition, are now understood to also have other functional capabilities that  contribute to the recruitment and stimulation of T lymphocytes and cells of the  innate immune system. Herein, these emerging insights are discussed as well as  the newly recognized influence on B cells of the Toll-like receptors, which are  postulated to be important sources of costimulation for autoreactive B cells.  Also discussed is how B-cell survival factors may contribute to the loss of  immune tolerance that leads to pathologic autoimmunity. These findings are part  of the rationale for the development of new specific B-cell-targeted therapies.

SP  - 74-82
AB  - Regulatory T-cells CD4+CD25+Foxp3, possessing suppressory activity, play the key  role in the development of autoimmune diseases, maintenance of peripheral  tolerance in transplantation immunity, and the prevention of a pathological  immune response to intestinal microflora or microbial infection. A decrease in  the total number of circulating CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells and their  suppressive activity have been found in patients suffering from various  autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune  hepatitis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). The authors of this study investigated the phenotypic  characteristics of peripheral blood lymphocytes in 31 SLE patients and the effect  of treatment on the content of CD4+CD25+ T-cells before and after pulse therapy  with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphan. The total number of regulatory T-cells  in the group of untreated patients was almost twice lower vs. the group of  healthy donors. As a result of the therapy, the proportion of regulatory T-cells  increased significantly, although it did not reach the values in the control  group. The data from this research confirm the development of a defect of  CD4+CD25+ T-cells at the active phase of SLE, and a possibility to partially  correct this defect with an effective therapy.

SP  - 2201-10
AB  - PURPOSE: The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects  and toxicities, drug interactions, dosage and administration, and safety issues  related to the use of prasterone are discussed. SUMMARY: Prasterone is a  proprietary synthetic dehydroepiandrosterone product under investigation for use  in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are taking glucocorticoids.  Initial trials investigated prasterone as a treatment to improve disease activity  and symptoms in women with mild to moderate SLE. The Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) did not approve prasterone's labeling for these indications. Subsequent  trials have focused on prasterone as a treatment to limit bone loss in women who  have SLE. A study was conducted to assess bone mineral density in patients who  had been taking glucocorticoids for six months or longer. The patients in the  prasterone group showed an increase in bone mineral density, while the placebo  group demonstrated a loss. The most common adverse effects of prasterone therapy  were acne and hirsutism. Hematuria, hypertension, and serum creatinine  concentration increases have also occurred. Interactions of prasterone  potentially exist with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors and additive or antagonistic  effects could possibly occur with androgens, estrogens, oral contraceptives, and  progestins. In clinical trials, oral prasterone dosages of 100-200 mg/day were  administered. These dosages have resulted in supraphysiological hormone levels.  CONCLUSION: FDA has granted orphan drug status for the prevention of loss of bone  mineral density in SLE patients taking glucocorticoids. FDA is requesting  additional Phase III trial data for the treatment of SLE and the prevention of  loss of bone mineral density.

T1  - [Pulmonary arterial hypertension in connective tissue disease].
SP  - 13S61-72
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is one of the most severe  complications of connective tissue diseases. PAH is defined by mean arterial  pulmonary pressure > 25 mmHg at rest (or 30 mmHg during exercise) during right  heart catheterisation. STATE OF THE ART: About 10% of cases of PAH are related to  connective tissue diseases. PAH may be observed in any of the connective tissue  diseases; it is mostly encountered in systemic sclerosis (prevalence estimated to  8%), and is more frequent in the limited form of the disease with anticentromeres  antibodies, in the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, of antinuclear antibodies,  decreased CO diffusion capacity, and during the perimenopausal period.  Histopathological lesions are similar to that of idiopathic PAH (with plexogenic  lesions being more rare); mutations have not been described. Venous  thromboembolic disease (especially in lupus) and hypoxemia related to pulmonary  fibrosis should be investigated. Screening for PAH is recommended in systemic  sclerosis (by echocardiography every year and in case of dyspnea). Few clinical  trials have been conducted specifically in PAH related to connective tissue  diseases, therefore the treatment approach is similar to that of idiopathic PAH,  with a poorer prognosis, including treatment with bosentan, epoprostenol and  other prostacyclin analogs, and sildenafil. Immunosuppressive therapy may  occasionally improve PAH in patients with systemic erythematosus lupus or mixed  connective tissue disease. PERSPECTIVES: Respective indications of drugs and  treatment associations need to be precised. CONCLUSION: The availability of  efficacious treatments of PAH justifies its screening and early diagnosis in  connective tissue diseases.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy.
SP  - 685-94
AB  - Women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) face significant risks when  embarking on a pregnancy, but attending a multidisciplinary clinic staffed by an  experienced team can improve pregnancy outcome for women and their babies.  Pregnancy in SLE should be planned and a management strategy should be agreed in  full consultation with the patient, prior to conception. Pregnancy increases the  likelihood of a lupus flare. It is not possible to predict when, or if, an  individual patient will flare, although flare is more likely if disease has been  active within 6 months of conception. Worsening of proteinuria in pregnancy could  herald a lupus flare, but the differential diagnosis also includes the  physiological response to pregnancy and pre-eclampsia. Corticosteroids,  hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine are safe to use in pregnancy, with no adverse  fetal effects reported despite many years of experience with their use. Correct  identification of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome is important because  treatment of affected women during pregnancy can improve fetal and maternal  outcome. Neonatal SLE, although rare, carries a significant mortality and  morbidity when the fetal heart is the targeted organ. Prophylaxis therapies,  including treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, await larger trials.

T1  - The management of pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 82-92
AB  - Most children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) now survive  into adulthood, leading the pediatric rheumatology community to focus on  preventing long-term complications of SLE, including atherosclerosis, obesity,  and osteoporosis, and their treatment. Unfortunately, because of the paucity of  data in pediatric SLE, little is known about epidemiology, long-term outcome, and  optimal treatment. Most research focuses on adults with SLE, but pediatric SLE  differs significantly from adult SLE in many aspects, including disease  expression, approaches to pharmacologic intervention, management of treatment  toxicity, and psychosocial issues. Children and adolescents with SLE require  specialized, multidisciplinary care. Treatment can be optimized by early  recognition of disease flares and complications, minimizing medication toxicity,  educating families about prevention, promoting school performance, addressing  concerns about reproductive health, and negotiating the transition to  adult-centered medical care. Developmentally appropriate concerns about pain,  appearance, and peers often affect treatment adherence and must be addressed by  the health-care team. Research in pediatric SLE is desperately needed and  provides a unique opportunity to understand how developmental immunology and the  hormonal changes associated with puberty affect the pathophysiology of SLE.

T1  - Optimum therapeutic approaches for lupus nephritis: what therapy and for whom?
SP  - 22-30
AB  - The optimum therapy for patients with lupus nephritis is a hotly debated topic.  Prospective randomized studies in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis  have established the superiority of cyclophosphamide to azathioprine, both of  which are used in combination with corticosteroids. Although high-dose,  intermittent administration of cyclophosphamide (pulse therapy) has significantly  reduced the toxicity associated with this drug, premature ovarian failure and  infections remain considerable problems. Short-term to intermediate-term,  randomized controlled trials have shown that mycophenolate mofetil is a good  option for the induction and maintenance of remission in lupus nephritis  patients. Additional longer-term trials involving more patients and stricter  outcomes based on renal function are needed, however, before claims that  mycophenolate mofetil is superior to cyclophosphamide can be substantiated. Until  such data are available, physicians caring for patients with lupus nephritis can  use mycophenolate mofetil as induction or maintenance therapy for selected  patients under close observation. Small noncontrolled trials with short-term  follow-up suggest that up to 50% of patients who are refractory to  cyclophosphamide might have a clinically significant response to rituximab, a  monoclonal antibody directed against B cells.

T1  - Clinical trial design in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 476-80
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to discuss the challenges  inherent in the design of clinical trials for patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent years have witnessed a renewed interest in  the conduct of systemic lupus erythematosus clinical trials. Three key design  decisions play particularly critical roles in determining the fate of these  trials: selection of the study population from among patients with very  heterogeneous disease manifestations; selection of the treatment and control  regimens; and selection of the primary endpoint. Four recent randomized,  controlled trials dealt with these decisions in the context of a variety of  interventions, including new biologic agents, hormonal therapies, and  anti-metabolites. These trials are informative about the implications of each  approach. SUMMARY: Systemic lupus erythematosus investigators are faced with  substantial trial design challenges because of the inherently complex nature of  this disease. The hope is that lessons learned from prior and ongoing trials will  inform future trial design such that the efficacy of new agents can be determined  and new therapies will become available for patients with SLE.

SP  - 101-2
AB  - Cerebellar vasculopathy is an uncommon but clinically important neuropsychiatric  syndrome of systemic lupus erythematosus (NP-SLE) for its ominous outcome and  need for prompt interventions. We described a young Chinese lady with systemic  lupus erythematosus and normal tension glaucoma, who had sudden headache, nausea  and vomiting coupled with rapid neurological deterioration leading to comatose  status. Diagnosis of lupus cerebellar vasculopathy was made and intense  immunosuppressive therapy consisting of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide was  commenced. Clinical condition was salvaged with marked improvement of both  sensorium and general well-being.

T1  - [Capillaroscopy and rheumatic diseases: state of the art].
SP  - 290-6
AB  - Nailfold capillaroscopy (NVC) represents the best method for analyzing  microvascular abnormalities in rheumatic diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon (RP)  represents the most frequent clinical aspect of microvascular involvement and is  a key feature of several such diseases. Under normal conditions or in primary RP  (exclusion by the cold-exposure test), the normal nailfold capillaroscopic  pattern shows a regular disposition of the capillary loops within the nail bed.  However, in subjects suffering from secondary RP, one or more alterations in the  capillaroscopic findings should alert the physician to search for an underlying  connective tissue disease. Architectural disorganization, giant capillaries,  hemorrhages, loss of capillaries and avascular areas characterize more than 95%  of patients with overt systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc). Therefore, the term  "scleroderma pattern", includes all capillaroscopic changes typical of the  microvascular involvement in SSc. The capillaroscopic aspects observed in  dermatomyositis and in undifferentiated connective tissue disease are generally  reported as "scleroderma-like patterns". This peripheral microangiopathy can be  effectively detected early in the course of the disease and studied in detail by  nailfold capillaroscopy or, better, with NVC. In addition, early differential  diagnosis between primary and secondary RP is the greatest advantage NVC has to  offer. In addition, interesting capillaroscopic changes have been observed in  systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome.  However, further epidemiological and clinical studies are needed to better  standardize NVC patterns.

T1  - Congenital complete heart block and maternal connective tissue disease.
SP  - 153-8
AB  - Congenital complete heart block can be isolated or can occur in association with  other structural heart diseases. Isolated congenital complete heart block (CCHB)  is due to transplacental transfer of autoantibodies from mothers with connective  tissue disease. Congenital heart block is usually complete, but incomplete  blocks, sinus bradycardia and QTc prolongation are also reported. Anti SS A and  Anti SS B antibodies transferred from mothers have inflammatory and  arrhythmogenic effects in the fetal conduction system. Cardiac manifestations  reported include dilated cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis and mitral  insufficiency. Low ventricular rate, QT prolongation and arrhythmias on  monitoring are high risk features. CCHB has a mortality of 30%, and 60% of  infants require pacemaker therapy. Fetal echocardiography is useful in early  diagnosis. Prophylactic steroid therapy is controversial. Beta adrenergic  agonists were tried in mothers with fetuses having congenital heart block to  increase fetal heart rate. Early pacemaker therapy is indicated in patients with  symptomatic bradycardia and ventricular dysfunction. The indications for pacing  in congenital heart block continue to evolve with advances in techniques and most  of these children will ultimately require permanent pacemakers by adulthood.

T1  - [Pulmonary arterial hypertension in collagenoses: clinical features, 
SP  - 297-300, 302-5
AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe vasculopathy, which is  characterised by progressive narrowing and obliteration of the pulmonary  arterioles and increased endothelin-1 levels. The increase of vascular resistance  in the lung vessels leads to chronic pressure overload and to right heart  failure, if untreated. PAH often occurs in association with  rheumatic-inflammatory diseases (e.g., in 15% of patients with systemic sclerosis  (SSc), especially in the limited form or in CREST patients) and determines their  prognosis: in advanced stages, untreated patients die within a short period.  Therefore all SSc patients, particularly the newly diagnosed ones, should be  screened for PAH with echocardiography. If PAH is suspected, a right heart  catheter should be performed, and if PAH is confirmed, adequate treatment should  be initiated. While few years ago lung transplantation was the only option for  patients with severe PAH, in recent years enormous progress was seen in drug  treatment. Today prostanoids (Ventavis) and the endothelin receptor antagonist  bosentan (Tracleer) are available for patients with PAH in WHO/NYHA stage III:  they have substantially improved the prognosis of PAH in the last years. Since  few months, also the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil (Revatio) is  available. The combination of drugs with different mode of action will likely  further improve the prognosis of PAH patients.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 6
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous disease, which  is autoimmune in origin and is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies  directed against nuclear antigens. It is a multi-system disease, and patients can  present in vastly different ways. Prevalence varies with ethnicity, but is  estimated to be about 1 per 1000 overall with a female to male ratio of 10:1. The  clinical heterogeneity of this disease mirrors its complex aetiopathogenesis,  which highlights the importance of genetic factors and individual susceptibility  to environmental factors. SLE can affect every organ in the body. The most common  manifestations include rash, arthritis and fatigue. At the more severe end of the  spectrum, SLE can cause nephritis, neurological problems, anaemia and  thrombocytopaenia. Over 90% of patients with SLE have positive anti-nuclear  antibodies (ANA). Significant titres are accepted to be of 1:80 or greater. SLE  is a relapsing and remitting disease, and treatment aims are threefold: managing  acute periods of potentially life-threatening ill health, minimizing the risk of  flares during periods of relative stability, and controlling the less  life-threatening, but often incapacitating day to day symptoms.  Hydroxychloroquine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for milder  disease; corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapies are generally reserved  for major organ involvement; anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is now used in  patients with severe disease who has not responded to conventional treatments.  Despite enormous improvements in prognosis since the introduction of  corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, SLE continues to have a significant  impact on the mortality and morbidity of those affected.

T1  - Th2 immune deviation induced by pregnancy: the two faces of autoimmune rheumatic 
SP  - 234-41
AB  - One of the most important immunological modifications during pregnancy is the  Th1/Th2 shift, due to the progressive increase of progesterone and estrogens  during pregnancy, which reach their peak-level in the third trimester of  gestation. At high levels, estrogens seem mainly to suppress Th1 cytokines and  stimulate Th2-mediated immunological responses as well as antibody production.  For this reason Th1-mediated diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tend to  improve and Th2-mediated disease, like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), tend  to worsen during pregnancy. SLE is the autoimmune rheumatic disease in which  pregnancy most frequently occurs because it predominantly affects young females  in their childbearing age. Other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including RA, are  less frequently observed during pregnancy due to their low female-to-male ratio  and peak onset after the age of 40. This review is focused on the disease course,  gestational outcome and management of patients with SLE and RA during pregnancy.

Correct management of these patients  requires combined medical-obstetric care, close surveillance of baby's growth and  well-being, control of SLE activity and correct thromboprophylaxis. With good  care, most pregnancies in women with SLE and APS end successfully.

AB  - Genesis of antinuclear antibodies is one of the most important immunological  abnormalities that are closely associated with clinical manifestations, disease  activity, and prognosis of systemic autoimmune diseases. Previous reports  indicated that autoreactive T cells have critical roles not only in antinuclear  antibody production but also in organ damages. Recently, the possible molecules  that are involved in the mechanism of antinuclear antibody production have been  determined by using lupus-prone mice. Target treatment against the key molecules  associated with autoreactive T cells and B cells may be the useful therapeutic  strategy for systemic autoimmune diseases along with the suppression of  disease-specific antinuclear antibody production.

AB  - Adolescence is a time of profound biological and psychosocial change. The  management of a complex chronic condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) during this period is a challenging but rewarding task for the clinician.  Early diagnosis and optimal disease control is essential in order to facilitate  normal adolescent development and minimize long-term disease sequelae. Current  treatment regimens are associated with significant toxicity in young people, and  there is a need for new, less toxic regimens. There are currently no controlled  therapeutic studies in adolescents with SLE. Those involved in the care of these  young people must ensure that they have appropriate access to specialist medical  services while ensuring that their specific needs as adolescents in the  health-care system are addressed.

AB  - Lupus nephritis is one of the more serious manifestations of the systemic  autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and is associated with  considerable morbidity and even mortality. Treatment remains problematic,  particularly in terms of controlling the underlying disease process while at the  same time preventing unacceptable side effects of therapy. In recent years,  clinical trials have started to define optimum regimens of the immunosuppressive  agents presently in use. The etiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus  erythematosus and lupus nephritis still are understood incompletely.  Nevertheless, insights gained from basic science research in both animals and  human beings now are being translated into newer therapies that have the  potential to be safer and more specific than those currently available.

SP  - 103-6, 108-9
AB  - Both clinically and scientifically, the variable organ manifestations of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) pose a particular challenge to rheumatologists.  Validated scores for disease activity (BILAG, ECLAM, SIS, SLAM, SLEDAI), damage  (SLICC/ACR damage index) and health-related quality of life (MOS SF-36) have been  successfully used for years. New therapies, however, need to show improvement on  outcome parameters for defined organ systems--and these are mostly ill-defined.  For proliferative lupus nephritis, well designed studies have been available for  years. However, these use very severe outcome parameters (renal failure, death),  and therefore take at least 5 years for definitive results. Of the surrogate  markers which were devised, none has proven reliable for determining outcome. The  combination of shorter studies for defining hopeful strategies followed by long  definitive studies, appears to be the best option at present.

AB  - The "Euro-Lupus Cohort" is composed by 1000 patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) that have been followed prospectively since 1991. These  patients have been gathered by a European consortium--the "Euro-Lupus Project  Group". This consortium was originated as part of the network promoted by the  "European Working Party on SLE", a working group created in 1990 in order to  promote research in Europe on the different problems related to this disease. The  "Euro-Lupus Cohort" provides an updated information on the SLE morbidity and  mortality characteristics in the present decade as well as defines several  clinical and immunological prognostic factors.

T1  - [Neonatal lupus syndromes].
SP  - 473-8
AB  - Children born from mothers positive for autoantibodies against SSA/Ro and/or  anti-SSB/La ribonucleoproteins may develop heart conduction tissue damage  resulting in atrioventricular block and/or transient skin rash, liver enzyme  abnormalities and anaemia/thrombocytopenia. Additional transient  electrocardiographic abnormalities (sinus bradycardia, QT interval prolongation)  have been reported. Such clinical and laboratory manifestations are included in  the so-called neonatal lupus syndromes, independently whether the mother is  suffering from a systemic autoimmune disease or is totally asymptomatic. The  prevalence of the congenital heart block is around 2%, of neonatal rash around  20%, while laboratory abnormalities in asymptomatic babies can be detected in up  to 40% of cases. The risk of recurrence of complete heart block is almost 10  times higher in the following pregnancies. Most of the mothers are asymptomatic  at delivery and are identified only by the birth of an affected child. Their  long-term outcome is generally more reassuring than previously assumed. Serial  echocardiograms and obstetric sonograms, performed at least every 2 weeks,  starting from 16 weeks gestation, are recommended in anti-Ro/SSA positive  pregnant women: the goal is to detect early fetal abnormalities, that might  precede complete atrioventricular block and that might be a target for preventive  therapy. Transplacental passage of maternal anti-SSA/Ro -SSB/La IgG is thought to  be pivotal in inducing tissue damage. However, the discordant appearance of the  syndrome in twins does suggest a role also for fetal or environmental factors.

AB  - Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used for replacement therapy in  immunodeficiency states and for immunomodulation of various autoimmune diseases.  Several case reports and series support a beneficial role of IVIg in systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), both as salvage immunotherapy and in control of  disease activity in general and amelioration of classical disease manifestations.  Further, lupus nephritis can also be treated usually successfully with IVIg. A  few questions remain unanswered as to the appropriate therapeutic dosage and the  clinical manifestations that can be best treated with IVIg.

SP  - 111-3
AB  - High dose pulse intravenous steroids with 1 g of methylprednisolone (MEP) given  daily, usually for three days, is an accepted practice to treat severe  manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic vasculitides,  despite the lack of definitive data. Most studies addressing the efficacy of high  dose glucocorticoids (GCs) have been uncontrolled, retrospective or did not  compare different doses. A limited number of studies comparing different doses of  GCs suggest that lower doses of MEP given as intravenous pulse therapy might be  as effective as the very high doses currently used. In addition, while early  reports did not find serious adverse effects related to very high doses of  steroids, several more recent studies indicate a high risk of serious infections  proportional to the current or cumulative dose of GCs. While we await more  conclusive studies addressing these questions, one might wonder whether we could  be using too much of a good thing.

AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease  affecting multiple organ systems, skin and joints the most involved. Lupus  Nephritis occurs in Approximately 50% of patients, sometimes it may be the first  manifestation of SLE. Clinical features range from asymptomatic urinary  abnormalities to full-blown nephrotic syndrome or rapidly progressive renal  failure. Because of the heterogeneity of clinical renal manifestations, renal  biopsy plays an important role in the management of patients with SLE: it  provides information about the class, severity, activity and chronicity of the  renal disease that cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of clinical  parameters. The complexity of protean renal manifestation of SLE can be  approached using the original WHO classification (1982), recently revised (2004).

SP  - 547-52
AB  - Early diagnosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a  challenge even to experienced rheumatologists. This is due to the diversity of  presentation with single or multiple manifestations and the variable course. In  contrast to the considerable progress in treatment modalities no reliable  diagnostic marker has been developed in the last years. So the diagnosis is made  largely on clinical grounds with great awareness of anamnestic features,  thoroughly performed physical examination supported by laboratory and  organspecific tests. The 1997 revised ACR classification criteria are of great  value, though they do not satisfy in every single case. With respect to the  potentially life or organ threatening course of SLE a good interdisciplinary  cooperation of general practitioners and specialists with rheumatologists is of  special importance.

SP  - 175-84
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical characteristics, laboratory features, approaches  to management, and predictors of outcome of chronic inflammatory demyelinating  polyneuropathy (CIDP) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  METHODS: An analysis of 6 adults with the concurrent diagnosis of CIDP and SLE  seen at a SLE Clinic from 1994 to 2004 with a review of 13 patients with SLE and  CIDP reported in the medical literature from 1950 through 2004. RESULTS: Among  our 6 patients with SLE and CIDP, 3 (50%) achieved a substantial clinical  response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and the remainder had a minimal  response. The improved patients were more likely to have received treatment  earlier (within 1 year of CIDP onset) and to respond faster (<1 to 3 months) than  minimally improved patients. They tended to have CIDP features of weakness of all  extremities, hyporeflexia of the upper extremities, and slowed nerve conduction  velocity of the motor median nerve. Compared with minimal responders, responders  had more serious internal organ manifestations and multiple autoantibodies  associated with SLE. Review of the literature identified 13 previously reported  CIDP patients with SLE. Many had neurological involvement of all extremities,  nerve biopsies showing demyelination, and serious SLE internal organ  manifestations. Most were treated with steroids, but the 1 treated with IVIg had  similar characteristics to our subset of patients who improved with IVIg.  CONCLUSIONS: CIDP is an uncommon, but not rare, manifestation of SLE. Certain  characteristics including early CIDP diagnosis, involvement of all 4 extremities,  hyporeflexia of the upper extremities, and slowed motor nerve conduction velocity  of the median nerve in addition to SLE involvement of critical internal organs  and the presence of multiple antibodies associated with SLE all appear to predict  a good response to IVIg.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a potentially preventable condition frequently encountered in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Bone loss in SLE is likely a  multi- factorial process involving traditional osteoporosis risk factors along  with lupus-related factors. Recognizing potential contributors to bone loss in  patients with SLE may allow earlier detection of osteoporosis, optimize bone  health, and minimize future fracture risk. This paper discusses recent  epidemiologic information related to osteoporosis and fractures in SLE, and  highlights relevant developments regarding evaluation and treatment of patients  at risk for bone loss.

SP  - 476-81
AB  - Certain cancers occur more frequently in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) as  compared with the general population, as recent data substantiates. The risk  appears to be most heightened for lymphoma. Several pathogenic mechanisms may  explain these observations, although little is definitively known. One particular  concern relates to whether cancer risk in SLE is increased by medication  exposures. Cooperative efforts to evaluate this have been undertaken by the  Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics and the Canadian Network for  Improved Outcomes in Systemic Lupus research groups. This and other works in  progress will, it is hoped, considerably advance the knowledge regarding the  association between autoimmune diseases and malignancy.

SP  - 469-75
AB  - Although the etiology of systemic lupus erythematosus is unknown, recent studies  have shed light on the pathogenetic pathways that lead to tissue damage. The  immune system in systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by a complex  interplay between overactive B cells, abnormally activated T cells, and  antigen-presenting cells. This leads to the production of an array of  inflammatory cytokines, diverse autoantibodies, and immune complexes that in turn  activate effector cells and the complement system leading to the clinical  manifestations of the disease.

T1  - Interferon pathway activation in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 463-8
AB  - The recognition that a multitude of interferon (IFN) coordinately expressed in peripheral blood cells of patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) has contributed to considerable interest in the IFN pathway  as a therapeutic target in lupus. Together with data that have accumulated over  the past four decades implicating IFN-alpha in SLE, the gene expression data have  resulted in emergence of this cytokine pathway as a focal point for understanding  mechanisms of autoimmunity and inflammation in systemic autoimmune diseases.  Assays that measure IFN-inducible gene expression in patient cells and tissues  and plasma assays that quantify IFN-alpha protein are providing tools for  identification of patients with active disease and who may be responsive to  inhibition of the innate immune system component of the altered immune response  in SLE. In addition, investigations of the mechanisms of induction of IFN pathway  activation are suggesting clues to the triggers of autoimmunity in SLE.

T1  - New therapies and preventive strategies to treat and minimize damage in lupus.
SP  - 457-62
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex disease characterized by a loss of  immune tolerance leading to autoantibody production, immune complex deposition in  target organs, and resultant tissue damage. There are currently only three  medications approved for the treatment of lupus; hydroxychloroquine, aspirin, and  prednisone. This limited spectrum of medications is contrasted by the dozen  clinical trials in lupus underway or planned for the next 2 years. These new  therapeutic agents hold promise for being more effective with fewer side effects  than the current available agents. Increased awareness of co-morbid diseases in  lupus is also leading to new approaches for the prevention of "disease damage" in  lupus.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children is a chronic multi-system disease  with wide ranging effects on their quality of life (QOL). While SLE's impact on  different arenas of life and well-being has been extensively examined in the  adult population, its effect on children has not received adequate attention.  This paper briefly discusses the multidimensional aspect of QOL, the  biopsychosocial implications of SLE, factors complicating QOL measurement in the  affected population, and the different generic and disease-specific scales used  for measuring QOL and related constructs, and it also highlights the need for  SLE-specific pediatric QOL instruments.

AB  - Although the pathogenesis of SLE remains poorly understood, there is consensus  that it involves a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors.  New technologies applied to genomic and gene expression studies have revealed  novel gene mutations and cytokine alterations in this disease. Recently, advances  in monoclonal antibodies and recombinant DNA technology have resulted in the  development of new drugs to arrest disease progression and restore physiologic  immune responses without major side effects. Clinical trials to test several of  these novel therapies are currently underway.

T1  - Pregnancy outcomes before and after a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 1444-55
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pregnancy outcomes before  and after diagnosis of lupus. STUDY DESIGN: Successive selection criterion  applied to 148 lupus and 78,905 non-lupus pregnancies, generated 3 groups: lupus  group, 84 pregnancies (not-yet-diagnosed group, 15 women; already-diagnosed  group, 69 women), and control group, 51,000 pregnancies. Three-way analysis of  variance and the chi-squared test were used for analyses. RESULTS: Stillbirth  outcome was increased in the lupus group compared with the control group (odds  ratio, 4.84 [95% CI, 1.72,11.08]); the not-yet-diagnosed group (odds ratio, 9.89  [95% CI, 1.09,42.63]), and the already-diagnosed group (odds ratio, 3.85 [95% CI,  1.02,10.31]). Considering >1 pregnancy per patient would have overestimated the  stillbirth rate. Stillbirth risk was increased significantly in severe maternal  disease that was marked by central nervous system involvement. The  already-diagnosed group had more hypertensive complications (P = .001 and .0001).  Both lupus groups showed a significantly greater proportion of preterm births (P  = .03), growth restriction (P = .019), and infants in the very low birth weight  category (P = .021) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Poor fetal  outcomes are seen in pregnancies that are complicated by lupus, even before  clinical appearance of disease, which supports a predisease state.

T1  - The role of immune ablation and stem cell transplantation in severe SLE.
SP  - 839-58
AB  - High-dose immunosuppression followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell  therapy (HSCT) has the promise of long-term response after a short, intense  period of immunosuppressive therapy but it is associated with an increased risk  of serious short-term complications. HSCT induces major clinical responses in  about 65% of patients with SLE who failed standard therapies. In some of these  patients such responses are durable for at least several years, but the curative  potential of this procedure in severe SLE is still unknown. Procedure-related  mortality varies among studies between 5 and 12% and seems to be lower in  relatively larger single center studies. Until more reliable estimates of the  actual risks and long-term outcomes become available, patients with potentially  life-threatening or disabling major organ involvement who are in acceptable  general medical condition should be considered for autologous HSCT if they have  failed a reasonable course of standard immunosuppressive therapy. To accomplish  the best therapeutic and scientific results, it is necessary to treat all  patients in carefully planned protocols by specialized teams of lupus specialists  and transplanters. All immunoablative protocols should incorporate carefully  planned studies of immune reconstitution to understand the mechanisms of cure or  failure.

T1  - Cardiovascular disease in lupus patients: should all patients be treated with 
SP  - 823-38
AB  - Premature coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of morbidity and  mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In certain age  groups, the risk can be >50 times that of an age-matched population. This  population also has an increased prevalence of several key classic risk factors  that contribute to the CHD development. Chronic inflammation, anti-phospholipid  antibodies and exposure to steroid therapy are also likely to have an impact. We  have adopted a proactive approach to classic risk factor management with 'ideal  targets' based on viewing SLE as a CHD equivalent condition. In this context, a  significant proportion of SLE patients (approximately 30%) will require statins  and the majority would be treated with aspirin prophylaxis. Better control of the  underlying inflammatory disease is also likely to play an important role and the  relative safety of anti-malarials allows their consideration as an adjunct in a  large proportion of patients. Well-conducted clinical trials are now needed to  advance beyond these initial recommendations.

T1  - Management of neuropsychiatric lupus.
SP  - 799-821
AB  - Nervous system disease in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is manifested by a  wide variety of clinical manifestations. Despite the development of a universal  classification for neuropsychiatric (NP) lupus in 1999, there continues to be  considerable variability in the reported prevalence of NP syndromes between  different lupus cohorts. Due to the lack of specificity of individual NP  manifestations, non-SLE causes such as complications of therapy and  co-morbidities must be considered in advance of attributing the event to one or  more primary immunopathogenic mechanisms. These include intracranial  microangiopathy, autoantibodies to neuronal and non-neuronal antigens, and the  generation of proinflammatory cytokines and mediators. The diagnosis of NP-SLE  remains largely one of exclusion and is approached in individual patients by  thorough clinical evaluation, supported when necessary by autoantibody profiles,  diagnostic imaging, electrophysiologic studies and objective assessment of  cognitive performance. Given the diversity in clinical manifestations, the  management is tailored to the specific needs of individual patients. In the  absence of controlled studies, the use of symptomatic therapies,  immunosuppressives, anticoagulants and non-pharmacologic interventions is  supported by case series and clinical experience.

SP  - 741-66
AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are  protean. Any part of the GI tract and the hepatobiliary system can be involved.  Up to two-third of SLE patients develop GI symptoms at some stage of their  illnesses. Clinical presentations of GI lupus are non-specific and can be  difficult to differentiate from infective, thrombotic, therapy-related and  non-SLE etiologies. Clinical acumen and appropriate endoscopic, biopsy and  imaging procedures are essential for establishing the correct diagnosis. Acute  abdominal pain in SLE patients can herald an intra-abdominal catastrophe and  should be evaluated promptly. Surgical intervention should be instituted without  delay if conservative management fails or when there is clinical or radiological  suspicion of visceral perforation or intra-abdominal collections.

T1  - Management of therapy-resistant systemic lupus erythematosus with rituximab: 
SP  - 102-5
AB  - Therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with major organ involvement  consists of aggressive immunosuppression with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic  agents. When remission is achieved, maintenance therapy is begun to reduce the  risk of relapse while minimizing toxicity. Remission with standard therapy is,  however, not always achieved. We discribe a women with SLE and microangiopathic  haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, pneumonitis and nephritis refractory to  high-dose steroids, pulse cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis and intravenous  immunoglobulins. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab was administered,  resulting in major clinical and biochemical improvement. Therapy-resistant SLE  generally has an ominous prognosis. A few anecdotal reports and small open  studies describe beneficial effects of rituximab in these cases. Rituximab may be  a promising new approach to improve the dismal outcome of therapy-resistant SLE.

AB  - This paper presents the view of literature on pregnancy in systemic lupus  erythematosus. It includes opinions on the risk of lupus exacerbation during the  pregnancy. Despite much researches, it was not possible to give a precise answer  to the question whether pregnancy induces increased rate of lupus flare. The  women suffering from SLE face higher risk of fetal losses, preterm births or  intrauterine growth retardations. However, if the pregnancy is properly planned  and under interdisciplinary medical care, it is highly possible, besides  exceptional cases, to give birth to a healthy child. Most of the authors do not  advise against pregnancy with lupus patients.

SP  - 217-28
AB  - Screening for disease-specific autoantibodies may be useful in asymptomatic  ANA-positive individuals as a means of evaluating the risk of developing a  systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),  polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), scleroderma (SSc), Sjogren's syndrome (SS),  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) in the future. In  patients with known or suspected systemic autoimmune disease, a panel of  disease-specific markers may help to establish a diagnosis and to assess the  prognosis. The great strides in autoantibody testing over the last 20 years make  it feasible to use specific autoantibody markers to improve diagnostic accuracy  in systemic autoimmune disease. New technology enabling screening for multiple  autoantibodies may further enhance the clinical usefulness of autoantibody  testing, making it possible to diagnose autoimmune disease in its earliest stages  and to intervene before serious end organ damage occurs.

SP  - 242-6
AB  - For a long time, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered a potentially  deadly disease. Since the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy, the life  expectancy and the quality of life of patients suffering from lupus erythematosus  has been dramatically improved. Today, the 5-year survival rate for SLE varies  between 50% and 95%. Still, not all patients benefit equally from medical  advances. Ethnic and/or socioeconomic minorities show severely disadvantageous  prognosis or outcome in various studies. A substantial reduction in the quality  of life as well as unemployment are other frequent side effects of this disease.  Vocational handicaps related to discoid lupus erythematodes (DLE) was seen in  nearly 45% of the patients. Therefore, the management of lupus erythematosus  patients requires interdisciplinary cooperation between physicians, psychologists  and social workers. The major aim of this article is to summarize the history of  lupus erythematosus on the one and the other hand to consider the role of the  socioeconomic factors influencing the prognosis of systemic and cutaneous lupus  erythematosus.

AB  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is a disease primarily characterized by  cardiac and/or cutaneous involvement. Hepatic, hematological, neurological and  pulmonary involvement are rare manifestations and normally considered as mild and  transient complications. But recent studies have shown more frequent hepatic  involvement in NLE. We report a two month-old male infant, born to a clinically  asymptomatic mother, presenting with significant hepatic involvement and annular,  erythematous plaques with hyperkeratotic borders at the eyebrow region and  anterior surface of trunk. Both the infant and his mother were positive for  anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B).

T1  - Therapeutic options for refractory massive pleural effusion in systemic lupus 
SP  - 744-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Massive refractory pleural effusions are uncommon in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus. Describing such a patient, the literature was  reviewed to report the various therapeutic options in such cases. METHODS:  MEDLINE search using the terms "lupus" and "pleural effusion," inclusion of cases  with refractory massive effusions with emphasis on treatment. RESULTS: Only 10  such cases (including the patient described here) were reported in the English  literature over the past 25 years. Those 10 patients suffered symptoms related to  pleural effusion for a long period of time until resolution, ranging between 2  months to 2.5 years (median 6 months). During that period of time they underwent  multiple fluid aspirations. Seven different types of therapy were reported in  these case descriptions. They can be divided into 2 major groups: systemic  therapy (immunosuppressive therapy, plasmapheresis, and intravenous  immunoglobulin) and local therapy (intrapleural steroid injections, pleurodesis  with talc or tetracycline, and pleurectomy). Pleurodesis with talc seemed to be  the most effective treatment modality. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the small number of  reported patients, the best type of intervention is uncertain. When refractory  pleural effusion is part of lupus exacerbation, the treatment of choice would be  systemic, such as immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose steroids and  cyclophosphamide. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also be considered. Local  measures such as talc pleurodesis should be employed if systemic measures fail,  or when pleural effusion is the only manifestation of lupus.

AB  - The most appropriate treatment of moderate, nonorgan threatening disease activity  in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains poorly defined, although  methotrexate (MTX) is commonly used. The results of 20 uncontrolled case series  and a single retrospective cohort study tend to support its use to treat active  skin and joint disease. Unfortunately, three prospective randomized trials have  reported conflicting results. Two reported improvement in overall disease  activity and decreased corticosteroid requirement with MTX. The third trial  showed no benefit from MTX for disease activity, but did report a reduction in  corticosteroid requirements. Difficulties in conducting trials in moderately  active SLE are discussed.

T1  - Renal transplantation in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 95-8
AB  - Most patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are suitable candidates for  renal transplantation. However, a number of them may present some disease-related  problems. As cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality  in SLE patients, a careful pretransplant cardiovascular screening is recommended.  A search for antiphospholipid antibodies is also useful as the presence of these  antibodies can cause an early graft thrombosis. The risk of recurrence of SLE  nephritis after transplantation may range between 2 and 30%. In most cases  recurrence is characterized by mild histologic lesions. Only rarely does it lead  to graft failure. Postransplant immunosuppression does not differ from that used  routinely. Whenever possible, a steroid-free immunosuppression should be  scheduled to prevent iatrogenic toxicity in patients who have already received  long-term steroid treatment. The results of kidney transplantation largely depend  on the clinical conditions at transplantation. In patients with poor clinical  status or receiving an aggressive immunosuppression it is advisable to postpone  the transplant. When some selection criteria are respected, the results of renal  trasplantation in SLE patients are at least as good as in other transplant  recipients.

T1  - Pregnancy after lupus nephritis.
SP  - 89-94
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects  primarily women, commonly in their reproductive years but does not influence  fertility. For these reasons, the clinician has often to face the many problems  of pregnancy in patients with SLE including the influence of SLE on fetal outcome  and that of pregnancy on SLE. As there is increasing evidence of an important  role of sex hormones in immunity, the influence of pregnancy on SLE is probably  due to the changes in sex hormone levels during pregnancy that are more important  than in any other period of life. Early reports emphasized a high fetal and  maternal risk in particular in patients with lupus nephritis. However in the same  period the prognosis of lupus nephritis was poor, so it was difficult to know  whether pregnancy actually influenced the prognosis of the disease. More recent  prospective studies indicate that pregnancy is safe for the majority of mothers  if it is planned when SLE is quiescent. Instead, although fetal risk has been  progressively reduced in the last 40 years, it continues to be higher than that  occurring in pregnancies of healthy women. In particular the presence of  antiphospholipid antibodies considerably worsen the fetal outcome.

T1  - Lupus nephritis in children.
SP  - 83-8
AB  - In systemic lupus erythematosus renal involvement is more frequent in children  than in adults. Overall, 60-80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus  have urinary or renal function abnormalities early in the disease course. In 90%  of patients, renal disease occurs within two years from disease onset. Clinically  significant renal involvement ranges from asymptomatic urinary findings to  nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Long-term prognosis is similar to that  observed in adults. Treatment aspects that are peculiar to children include drug  side-effects, such as growth inhibition induced by steroids, the need to consider  morbidity-related issues with respect to the very long life expectancy of  patients and the problems related to the impact of disease in adolescents. The  recent availability of a childhood SLE definition of improvement and the presence  of large international paediatric rheumatology networks should, in the future,  facilitate the implementation of controlled clinical trials devoted to paediatric  SLE.

Our assumptions about the underlying mechanisms are based on the combination  of extrapolations from idiopathic membranous nephritis (mainly from animal  models) and proliferative lupus nephritis. Natural history studies of MLN suggest  a relatively low rate of progression to end-stage renal disease but a high rate  of significant comorbidities. Historical changes in the criteria for pathologic  diagnosis and classification of membranous lupus nephropathy have precluded  definitive descriptions of the natural history, prognosis and treatment of this  disorder. Patients with membranous lupus nephropathy should be treated early with  angiotensin antagonists to minimize proteinuria, as well as lifestyle changes and  appropriate drugs to reduce attendant cardiovascular risk factors. In patients  with protracted nephrotic syndrome, consideration should be given to  immunosuppressive therapies, including corticosteroids, cyclosporine,  mycophenolate and cyclophosphamide. Prospective controlled trials are clearly  needed in order to establish solid clinical practice guidelines for use of these  drugs and other experimental therapies currently under study in membranous lupus  nephropathy.

T1  - Mycophenolate mofetil in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 59-64
AB  - There is an increasing body of literature suggesting the efficacy and  tolerability of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for the treatment of lupus nephritis.  The rationale for its use is based upon its successful profile as an  immunosuppressive agent for prevention of allograft rejection, as well as studies  in murine models of lupus which have reported improved renal function and animal  survival compared to placebo. This report reviews the data regarding MMF therapy  in murine lupus models, and describes the initial anecdotal experience with MMF  in human lupus, especially in patients with glomerulonephritis who were  unresponsive to corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, or who had unacceptable  toxicity on this standard of care regimen. The results of several nonblinded,  controlled clinical trials are also described, in which MMF was compared to  intravenous or oral cyclophosphamide in patients with lupus nephritis. MMF was  found to be well tolerated, with most studies showing fewer infections than that  associated with cyclophosphamide. Efficacy of MMF was at least equivalent to  cyclophosphamide, and therefore appears to provide an alternative as a standard  of care for induction and maintenance treatment of lupus nephritis.

T1  - Lupus nephritis flares.
SP  - 49-52
AB  - The clinical course of lupus nephritis varies remarkably among SLE patients, even  between those with the same histological type. Current immunosuppressive agents  induce remission in the majority of the patients with proliferative lupus  nephritis, but a substantial proportion of them - ranging in different studies  from 27% to 66% - will flare. Flares represent a significant problem because of  the potential for cumulative damage that may lead to deterioration of renal  function as well as toxicity due to the additional immunosuppression. Maintenance  therapy with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or quarterly pulses of  cyclophosphamide is usually recommended. Renal flares can be characterized as  nephritic or nephrotic and can be mild or severe. The majority of the patients  that flare restore renal function, if diagnosed early and treated promptly.  However, current immunosuppressive agents have limitations concerning efficacy  and toxicity profiles. Unresolved management issues include the value of repeat  renal biopsy and issues related to optimal strategy/regimen to prevent flares.  Renal flares are an important feature of the natural history of lupus nephritis  and provide an opportunity for additional preventive strategies, as well as  measures of efficacy in future therapeutic trials.

T1  - Prognostic factors in lupus nephritis.
SP  - 39-44
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous disorder and its renal  manifestations are protean. The course and prognosis of lupus nephritis is  dependent on a large number of demographic, histopathological, serological,  racial, socioeconomic and time dependent factors. Moreover, the initial and  maintenance therapeutic regimens may also influence the long term renal outcome.  This article reviews the important prognostic factors that have been reported in  literature. The management strategy of lupus nephritis should be individualized  and based on a composite of these parameters.

T1  - Safety of hydroxychloroquine in pregnant patients with connective tissue 
SP  - 111-5
AB  - Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is widely used in the treatment of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). Even if it is generally agreed that pregnancy per se  increases disease activity in patients with SLE and that withdrawal of HCQ at the  onset of pregnancy may result in exacerbation of SLE, use of HCQ during pregnancy  has remained controversial for a long time. Parke was the first to propose  continuation of HCQ throughout gestation. Currently, more than 250 pregnancies  resulting in live births have been reported and no increase in the rate of birth  defects have been demonstrated. When studied, no retinal toxicity and ototoxicity  have been found. Data concerning lactation and HCQ treatment are rare. However,  the amount of HCQ received by children through lactation seems very low. In  conclusion, HCQ should probably be maintained throughout pregnancy in patients  with SLE and it does not seem necessary to advise against breastfeeding.

T1  - B cell-targeted therapy in diseases other than rheumatoid arthritis.
SP  - 25-8; discussion 29-30
AB  - There are now numerous case reports and small series using rituximab in  autoimmune diseases. While these data must be interpreted with caution, they  suggest that rituximab (RTX) may be a promising addition to the therapeutic  armamentarium. In patients with refractory chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic  purpura, treatment with RTX was effective in inducing complete responses in a  significant proportion of patients, and these responses were usually durable. RTX  has also been shown to be effective and well tolerated in children with  refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. In patients with IgM antibody-associated  polyneuropathy, RTX improved muscle strength, and repeated treatments over 2  years were well tolerated. In several case series of patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus, depletion of B cells during RTX therapy was associated with  improvement in global disease activity. Based on these reports, further  controlled studies are warranted to optimize RTX as monotherapy and to develop  combination therapies in patients with refractory autoimmune diseases.

T1  - Treatment of acute neuropsychiatric lupus with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): 
SP  - 394-7
AB  - Neuropsychiatric lupus can be difficult to diagnose, and little prospective data  exists to help direct management. In this case report we describe the acute onset  of symptoms of depression, mania, and psychosis and their complete resolution 48  h following a 5-day treatment course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in a  20-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We review the  literature on IVIG for the management of neuropsychiatric lupus. We propose that  when more toxic therapies are refused or symptoms do not remit with other  treatments, IVIG should be considered in patients with neuropsychiatric lupus.

T1  - The HELLP syndrome in the antiphospholipid syndrome: retrospective study of 16 
SP  - 273-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of the haemolysis, elevated liver  enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome in the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)  and its influence on the subsequent pregnancies. METHODS: This was a  retrospective analysis of 16 episodes of HELLP complicating APS in 15 women.  RESULTS: HELLP was complete in 10 cases and partial in six. It occurred during  the second trimester in seven cases (the earliest at 18 weeks' gestation), the  third trimester in seven cases, and the day following delivery in two cases.  Pre-eclampsia was present in six cases and eclampsia in five. Outcome of  pregnancies was: live birth (n = 8), stillbirth (n = 2) and fetal death (n = 6).  APS was primary in nine women and secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  in six. HELLP revealed primary APS in six cases. Seven women were not treated.  Low dose aspirin was empirically prescribed in one woman whose APS had been  undiagnosed despite a history of two fetal deaths. In the other women, therapy  consisted of aspirin (n = 8), low molecular weight heparin with a dose varying  between 3000 and 12 000 U daily (n = 5), and high dose immunoglobulin every 4  weeks (n = 2), hydroxychloroquine (n = 4), and prednisone (n = 6). Six women had  seven subsequent pregnancies, 3-6 years after the complicated pregnancy. HELLP  recurred at 33 weeks' gestation in one woman with SLE treated with prednisone,  hydroxychloroquine, aspirin, and enoxaparin, and pregnancy ended in live birth.  One woman became pregnant after in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer, but  pregnancy ended in fetal death despite prednisone, hydroxychloroquine, and  enoxaparin. Four women had five uneventful pregnancies with 100 mg daily aspirin  and heparin. CONCLUSIONS: APS may be revealed by HELLP. In APS, HELLP is  associated with pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in most cases and seems to occur earlier  than in the general population. Heparin plus aspirin may prevent obstetric  complications in the subsequent pregnancies.

AB  - Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, called Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease (KFD),  is an idiopathic, self-limited condition rarely associated with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). The cause of concomitant KFD and SLE is still unknown. We  describe a 19-year-old man simultaneously diagnosed with both KFD and SLE  complicated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). To the best of our knowledge, this  is the first case report of KFD associated with SLE complicated with  antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). Our patient was successfully treated  with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone, anticoagulation with heparin, oral  hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and low-dose aspirin.

T1  - Multiple sclerosis, neuropsychiatric lupus and antiphospholipid syndrome: where 
SP  - 434-42
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid  syndrome (APS) are chronic, immune-mediated, relapsing-remitting disorders  affecting young adults, the pathogenesis of which is still largely unknown.  Neurological manifestations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be  indistinguishable and there are no specific diagnostic tools. Treatment and  prognosis are quite different. There is controversy about the prevalence and  significance of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in MS. A significant number of  patients with APS/SLE are misdiagnosed as MS but evidence suggests they are  distinct nosological entities. However, it is essential to differentiate them  since APS may be responsive to anticoagulation. When assessing MS patients,  clinicians should consider APS/SLE, especially if the MS has atypical features. A  trial of anticoagulation might be worthwhile in some patients with atypical MS  and consistently positive aPL.

T1  - The role of kidney biopsy in the management of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 1-8
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review evaluates the role of kidney biopsy as a tool in  the diagnosis, prognostication and therapeutic management of lupus nephritis. The  renal biopsy is the only method available for diagnosing and classifying lupus  nephritis. However, disagreements persist regarding the appropriate role of a  renal biopsy in the management and identification of predictors of short and  long-term outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent modifications to the classification  of lupus nephritis, the emergence of newer scoring indices, and the availability  of a variety of therapeutic options predicate a reassessment of the role of the  renal biopsy in the management of lupus nephritis, especially for high-risk  patients. SUMMARY: Despite some controversy, the renal biopsy has been shown to  provide information over and above that provided by the clinical variables, and  remains a pivotal element in optimizing therapy and the rational management of  lupus nephritis.

SP  - 338-44
AB  - A 18-year-old female had low grade fever, butterfly rush, proteinuria,  leukocytopenia and hypocomplimentemia in 1988, and she was diagnosed as systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis (WHOIIb). Treatments with  prednisolone and mizoribine resulted in the remission for three years. In May  2001, she presented neurosis and polakisuria despite of the increase of  prednisolone to 20 mg/day. Finally, she admitted in our hospital because of manic  and repressive state and disorientaion. A brain MRI revealed high intensity  lesions in bilateral basal ganglia in T2 weighted images, and cerebrospinal fluid  showed elevated protein and IFN-alpha (421 IU/ml). In addition, she manifested  neurogenic bladder, muscle weakness and hyperactive deep tendon reflex of  bilateral lower limbs due to both supranuclear disorder and hypesthesia under the  Th 10 level. Spinal MRI revealed marked atrophy and high intensity signals at the  middle to lower thoracic spinal cord in T2 weighted images, indicating  complication of lupus myelitis as well as cerebral involvement. Although the  symptoms of CNS lupus did not respond to prednisolone, twelve monthly  cyclophosphamide pulse therapy (IV-CY) has resolved urinary disturbance, muscle  weakness and sensory loss, along with the improvement of both cerebral and spinal  MRI images. Lupus myelitis and neurogenic bladder are the rare, but very  refractory manifestation among CNS involvement of SLE. We here propose IV-CY as  an invaluable choice for the treatment of not only active lupus myelitis but also  neurogenic bladder resisted for steroid.

T1  - [Autologous bone marrow transplantation as a treatment for autoimmune disease: 
SP  - 531-9
AB  - Autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune response against self antigens.  One of the current research interests in this field is oriented toward  development of tolerance. One of the newest options in the search for tolerance  is autologous bone marrow transplantation: a variant of bone marrow transplant in  which the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells are reinfused after  myeloablative therapy. The idea of using bone marrow transplant in treatment of  autoimmune diseases derived from observing remission in autoimmune diseases in  patients transplanted due to coexisting neoplastic disease. Although an isolated  initial report of bone marrow transplant as treatment for autoimmune disease  questioned the utility of this procedure, over all, results are encouraging. To  compile information in a programmed and systematic manner, it is necessary to  send more patients in all stages of immune diseases to specialized centers to be  included in large multicenter randomized trials. In time, the role for this  procedure in autoimmune diseases will become clear.

T1  - Primary versus secondary antiphospholipid syndrome: is this lupus or not?
SP  - 445-50
AB  - Antiphospholipid syndrome is a hypercoaguable state characterized by recurrent  venous and/or arterial thrombosis and/or pregnancy complications of fetal loss,  pre-eclampsia, or eclampsia in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. It  was first described in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus and  subsequently recognized to also exist as an independent condition and in  conjunction with a variety of other autoimmune, infectious, and malignant  illnesses. These diseases have been called primary antiphospholipid syndrome and  secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. However, the two conditions can have  significant overlapping features. This paper reviews the similarities and the  differences between the two conditions.

SP  - 740-51
AB  - PURPOSE: Parvovirus B19 (B19) causes many clinical disorders, of which the most  common are erythema infectiosum, aplastic crisis complicating chronic hemolytic  anemia, and hydrops fetalis. In young adults, the skin eruption caused by B19 is  accompanied by polyarthritis and polyarthralgia in 60% of the cases. Rheumatoid  factors and other antibodies including antinuclear antibodies, anti-ADN, and  antiphospholipids can be produced in the wake of B19 infection. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE  AND KEY POINTS: These features may simulate systemic diseases as rheumatoid  arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (lupus-like eruption over the  cheeks, cytopenia, etc.) or vasculitis (purpura, renal involvement). In addition,  there have been a few reports of SLE, vasculitis and other connective tissue  diseases developing shortly after a B19 infection associated with virus clearance  suggesting that B19 can act as a trigger of systemic disease. However, studies in  large series indicate that in fact B19 is probably an extremely rare cause of RA,  SLE or vasculitis. FUTURE PROSPECTS AND PROJECTS: In fundamental studies B19  interacts with inflammatory cells by regulation of cytokines. More recently, two  studies suggest that viral infection due to B19 may affect the course of SLE,  leading to specific biological subsets. These preliminary findings require  confirmation to elucidate the significance of the presence of B19 in systemic  disease.

SP  - 732-9
AB  - PURPOSE: DNA chip is a recently developed technique allowing analysis of  thousands of genes at the same time in multiple biological samples. In few years  it has become an obligatory step in massive gene expression study. The enormous  quantity of results generated and the new way of thinking allowed make this kind  of study a true revolution. KEY MESSAGE AND RECENT FACTS: The enormous discovery  potential permitted by the accomplishment of multiple genomes sequencing and the  advent of technologies allowing massive gene expression analyses have totally  modified the diseases approach. Considering the obtainment of a real full picture  of the transcriptional activity in an organ, tissue or cell is now legitimate.  DNA microarray is obviously not the only technique allowing such type of analysis  but it is without contest the technology which is the most popular and the one  which has been recently the subject of the most important developments. It is  certainly the technology which brought the main advances in tumour classification  and discovery of new biomarkers. The first results based on this technology in  inflammatory diseases have recently been reported. PERSPECTIVE AND PROJECTS: The  optimal use of DNA microarrays will necessitate a powerful statistical analysis  and an high quality biological experimentation. Strict standard and quality  criteria are developing. Obviously, the DNA chips have a role to play in  multifactorial inflammatory diseases mainly through their potential to bring new  answers to diagnostic and pathophysiological problems. One potential development  of the technique in such diseases will be the definition of disease specific gene  profiles and the generation of chips allowing the detection of few targeted genes  with all the known mutations of these genes. The correlation of global or  targeted gene expression with clinical and pathological data will allow a new  step forward in the understanding and taking care of inflammatory diseases.

T1  - Antiphospholipid syndrome associated with infections: clinical and 
SP  - 1312-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyse the clinical characteristics of 100 patients  with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) associated with infections. METHODS:  Patients were identified by a computer assisted search (Medline) of published  reports to locate all cases of APS published in English, Spanish, and French from  1983 to 2003. The bilateral Fisher exact test was used for statistics. RESULTS:  59 female and 41 male patients were identified (mean (SD) age, 32 (18) years  (range 1 to 78)): 68 had primary APS, 27 had systemic lupus erythematosus, two  had "lupus-like" syndrome, two had inflammatory bowel disease, and one had  rheumatoid arthritis. APS presented as a catastrophic syndrome in 40% of cases.  The main clinical manifestations of APS included: pulmonary involvement (39%),  skin involvement (36%), and renal involvement (35%; nine with renal thrombotic  microangiopathy, RTMA). The main associated infections and agents included skin  infection (18%), HIV (17%), pneumonia (14%), hepatitis C (13%), and urinary tract  infection (10%). Anticoagulation was used in 74%, steroids in 53%, intravenous  immunoglobulins in 20%, cyclophosphamide in 12%, plasma exchange in 12%, and  dialysis in 9.6%. Twenty three patients died following infections and thrombotic  episodes (16 with catastrophic APS). Patients given steroids had a better  prognosis (p = 0.024). The presence of RTMA and requirement for dialysis carried  a worse prognosis (p = 0.001 and p = 0.035, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Various  different infections can be associated with thrombotic events in patients with  APS, including the potentially lethal subset termed catastrophic APS. Aggressive  treatment with anticoagulation, steroids, and appropriate antibiotic cover is  necessary to improve the prognosis.

T1  - New advances in measurement of complement activation: lessons of systemic lupus 
SP  - 375-81
AB  - Activation of the complement system plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis  of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). For the past several decades, quantifying  this process has focused primarily on determination of serum C3 and C4, although  the utility of these assays for diagnosis and monitoring disease activity is  still debated. During this same timespan, knowledge of the complement system has  exploded, with identification of more than 30 proteins, an abundance of newly  recognized functions, and even a third pathway of activation. These advances  suggest that it is appropriate to revisit the complement system as a potential  source of biomarkers for SLE. This paper reviews briefly the role of complement  in SLE and other inflammatory diseases, discusses conventional methods for  complement measurement and their drawbacks, and focuses on recent advancements in  harnessing the complement system for monitoring SLE. Specifically, novel assays  that measure cell-bound complement activation products are introduced and their  utility as biomarkers of SLE disease activity is discussed.

T1  - Occupational and environmental exposures as risk factors for systemic lupus 
SP  - 367-74
AB  - Although genetic susceptibility plays a strong role in the etiology of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), recent research has provided new evidence of the  potential influence of environmental factors in the risk for this disease. This  paper describes epidemiologic and experimental research pertaining to  occupational and environmental sources of exposure to respirable crystalline  silica, solvents and pesticides, and two "lifestyle" factors (smoking and hair  dye use). As has been seen with other systemic autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic  sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis), a series of epidemiologic studies, using  different designs in different settings, have demonstrated relatively strong and  consistent associations between occupational silica exposure and SLE. The type  and quality of exposure assessment is an important consideration in evaluating  these studies. Recent experimental studies examined the effect of  trichloroethylene exposure in MRL+/+ mice, but to date there have been few  epidemiologic studies of solvents and SLE. There are numerous avenues with  respect to environmental factors in SLE that need additional research.

T1  - Stem cell transplantation in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 291-304
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a heterogeneous, multisystem disease responsive  to treatment with corticosteroids and immune suppressives. Many patients fail to  achieve treatment-free remissions, and their long-term outcomes remain poor owing  to the development of vital organ failure, cumulative drug toxicity and an  increased risk of cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Haematopoietic stem cell  transplantation (HSCT) offers the potential to improve long-term outcome in those  with a poor prognosis. Preliminary phase II and registry studies have usually  employed non-myeloablative conditioning with positive CD34 cell selection. They  have highlighted the potential efficacy and dangers of HSCT. Patient selection is  important but complex, and the influence of HSCT on long-term outcome is unknown.  Disease relapse occurs in up to one-third of patients after HSCT, but the  consequences of relapse and the role of remission-maintenance strategies are  unknown. With the availability of other alternative therapies in refractory  disease, there needs to be a clear demonstration of the benefits of HSCT from  current randomized trials.

T1  - Immunologic factors in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis.
SP  - 259-63, vii
AB  - Osteonecrosis is a disease in which death of cellular elements of bone occurs as  a result of diminished arterial blood supply. The pathogenetic mechanisms of  osteonecrosis remain unresolved. Extravascular pressure and subsequent tamponade  of the arterial vessels or an intravascular thrombosis have been suggested.  Immunologic factors may also play an important role. In autoimmune disorders,  small vessel vasculitis or other disease-associated features, as well as  antiphospholipid antibodies, have been involved in the development of  osteonecrosis.

T1  - Clinical trial design in systemic lupus erythematosus: lessons learned and future 
SP  - 406-11
AB  - Designing successful randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) poses many challenges. It remains difficult to correlate  alterations in biologic markers with clinical outcome, especially when signs and  symptoms are intermittent and broadly variable between patients. Disease activity  indices were not designed specifically as outcome measures in RCTs, as they were  developed in the context of longitudinal observational studies. Although all  disease activity indices have been validated against each other and demonstrated  to show change, organ system manifestations are variably weighted; fatigue and  autoantibody titers are scored in some and not in others. Due to the variability  of the underlying disease course an assessment of disease activity may most  accurately be portrayed as change over time, such as an area under the curve  analysis. Another lesson learned is that 'responder indices' proposed in the  absence of prospective validation in RCTs do not function well. The argument can  always be made that any response criteria will work if the treatment is  effective; but without the precedent of a product specifically approved for use  in SLE, this is hard to prove. The ACR/Systemic Lupus International Cooperating  Clinics (SLICC) damage index was designed to score irreversible manifestations of  disease or consequences of its treatment, provided they had been present for at  least six months. The damage index may best be utilized to stratify patients or  balance randomization at baseline. It may also be incorporated into an endpoint  analysis, to ensure that treatment or disease associated deterioration in organ  system function (that may be overlooked in scoring disease activity alone) has  not occurred. Patient cohort data have demonstrated that the medical outcomes  survey short form-36 (SF-36) reflected the effects of SLE better than other  patient reported measures. Worsening SF-36 domain scores best correlate with  higher disease activity, increased glucocorticoid doses and use of cytotoxic  agents. It has been shown sensitive to change in RCTs and observational cohorts,  and reflects the impact of treatment with high dose glucocorticoids and  immunosuppressive agents, as well as end stage renal disease. There is now a body  of data derived from RCTs in SLE. Albeit limited, yet to result in an approved  therapy, evidence is accumulating that indicate 'early markers' of response can  be defined which may correlate with longer term clinical outcomes. This should  inform us in our ongoing efforts to clinically test a broad variety of promising  interventions.

T1  - Randomized controlled trials in systemic lupus erythematosus: what has been done 
SP  - 398-405
AB  - The study of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a challenging undertaking. It  is difficult to assess outcomes in SLE randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and  this is illustrated by the lack of new therapies approved for use in lupus. In a  disease that is waxing and waning, and requires constantly changing medications,  identifying treatment effects of new therapies may be difficult, and the use of  potentially toxic therapies requires a rigorous understanding of the benefit to  risk ratio. Some issues that need to be considered by the investigator in  designing these studies include: 1) should the trial focus on patients with  active or inactive disease; 2) which of the measures of disease activity should  be used or should prevention of flares be examined; 3) should the study focus on  defined organ specific endpoints or utilize one of the available disease activity  indices to identify changes in disease activity; 4) should the trial be a  superiority trial or an equivalence trial. This review summarizes the critical  issues involving the design of studies in lupus and provides the reader with  suggestions and recommendations for consideration before embarking on trials in  this area.

T1  - Making pregnancy safer for patients with lupus.
SP  - 178-82
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus is a hormone-dependent disorder predominantly  affecting young women in whom changes in hormonal activity affect the course of  the disease. More specifically, pregnancy is associated in 50 to 60% of cases  with a clinical flare manifesting as renal or hematological symptoms, usually  during the second or third trimester but occasionally in the postpartal period.  Patients should be strongly advised to start a pregnancy only if their disease  has been stable for at least 6 months, and they should be informed of the few  contraindications. Severe flares are uncommon (10%) and the risk of maternal  death is now 2 to 3%. The risk of the fetus remains high, however. Thus, fetal  loss is common, particularly in patients with a lupus anticoagulant, renal  failure, or arterial hypertension. Preterm birth occurs in 25% to 50% of cases  and intrauterine growth retardation in 30%. Neonatal lupus with or without  congenital heart block is exceedingly rare, being seen in the 1% of SLE women who  have anti-SSA (Ro) and/or SSB (La) antibodies. To ensure a favorable outcome for  both the mother and the child, the pregnancy should be planned, started during a  period of disease stability, monitored closely (physical examination, laboratory  tests, and Doppler ultrasound), and treated as needed (with antimalarial therapy  throughout the pregnancy). Even with these precautions, however, preterm birth  remains common.

The histopathologic definition of vasculitis varies from report to report. In  this article, vasculitis is defined as histopathologic features of blood vessel  damage: There should be evidence of leukocytoclasis and vessel wall destruction,  which may or may not be accompanied by fibrinoid deposits. Red blood cell  extravasation and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrate also may be present.  The extent to which each of these elements must be present has been debated.

T1  - [Psychiatric disorders in rheumatic diseases, as exemplified by systemic lupus 
SP  - 122-30
AB  - Among the rheumatic diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) reveals the  highest frequency of central nervous symptoms. Psychiatric abnormalities are  present in over 90% of the patients, if very mild cognitive impairment is  included. The psychiatric syndromes listed by the American College of  Rheumatologists encompass cognitive syndromes, including the acute confusional  state, anxiety disorders, depressive symptomatology and psychosis. Associations  between cognitive impairment and demographic and disease variables, i. e. disease  severity, have not been clearly identified so far. The same holds true for the  evolution of depressive symptoms. Reactive depression in coping with a chronic  disease is, however, a psychologically plausible factor in addition to specific  cerebral lesions. Therapeutic interventions in SLE should consist of a combined  pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. Corticosteroid drugs, however,  may be effective in alleviating mild psychiatric symptoms as well.

SP  - 513-9
AB  - This article overviews the immunomodulation effects and clinical evidence of  apheresis in renal diseases, in particular primary and secondary  glomerulonephritis. A considerable permeability factor(s) derived from  circulating T cells is speculated to have a crucial role in the proteinuria of  nephrotic syndrome (NS). Plasma exchange (PE), immunoadsorption using Protein A  sepharose cartridges, low-density lipoprotein apheresis and lymphocyte apheresis  (LCAP) were tried to remove such factors or pathogenic T cells. Other glomerular  diseases induced by specific antibodies such as antiglomerular basement membrane  antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and immune-complexes such as  lupus nephritis were also treated with PE, double filtration plasma apheresis.  IAPP and LCAP. Many reports suggested that apheresis might have beneficial  immunomodulation effects for the treatment of glomerular diseases: however, the  recommendations based on evidence from small cohorts remain at low-level in most.

AB  - Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome  in adults. The frequency of secondary forms varies from 20 to 30 per cent. The  principal causes appear to be systemic lupus erythematosous, drug therapy,  malignancy and viral infection. The pathology includes normocellular glomeruli  with subepithelial deposits on the outer surface of the glomerular basement  membrane. Immunofluorescence studies reveal consistently IgG granular deposits.  Prolonged high-grade proteinuria is common. Renal vein thrombosis is frequently  associated. Persistent hyperlipidemia increases the risk of cardiovascular  diseases. The course of idiopathic membranous nephropathy remains variable.  Numerous factors affecting the prognosis of the nephropathy have been identified  and should be considered for the decision of specific treatment and use of  immunosuppressive therapy.

SP  - 771-8
AB  - Circulating autoantibodies against ribosomal proteins characterise a subset of  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Following the identification of three  phosphorylated proteins as the main ribosomal autoantigens recognised by these  autoantibodies, several studies have been carried out in the last decade to set  up a reliable and sensitive method of detecting anti-ribosome autoantibodies and  disclosing their possible clinical relevance in the diagnosis and monitoring of  symptoms and signs of the disease. Although a number of clinical associations  have been proposed, contrasting results have emerged from these investigations.  This review analyses the methodological problems linked with the various  techniques used to detect anti-ribosome antibodies and provides a critical update  of the clinical associations described in lupus patients to date.

AB  - Headache is a common feature in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and represents a significant source of patient discomfort. The exact prevalence  of headache in SLE is unknown. The results of different studies widely vary, most  likely due to the use of different classification for headache and the lack of  controls in most studies. The relationship between headache and SLE is also  unclear since it is difficult to determine which degree and type of headaches can  be explained on the basis of chronic illness, or as part of the disease spectrum  of SLE. No pathogenic mechanism has so far been described that can fully explain  headache induced by SLE. The role of circulating cytokines, vascular injury,  neuronal damage or antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the development of  headache in SLE patients is also a matter of debate. Other concomitant causes  such as infection or hypertension should be excluded before assuming that  headache is a feature of SLE activity. Therapeutic approach of headache  SLE-related remains empirical and based on clinical experience.

T1  - Central nervous system lupus: a clinical approach to therapy.
SP  - 935-42
AB  - Management of central nervous system (CNS) involvement still remains one of the  most challenging problems in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The best  available evidence for the treatment of CNS lupus is largely based on  retrospective series, case reports and expert opinion. Current therapy is  empirical and tailored to the individual patient. Symptomatic, immunosuppressive  and anticoagulant therapies are the main strategies for the management of CNS  lupus. The choice depends on the most probable underlying pathogenic mechanism  and the severity of the presenting neuropsychiatric symptoms. Thrombotic and  nonthrombotic CNS disease needs to be differentiated and requires different  management strategies. However, this is often challenging since many, if not most  CNS manifestations, may be due to a combination of different pathogenic  mechanisms and multiple CNS events may occur in the individual patient. Patients  with mild manifestations may need symptomatic treatment only, whereas more severe  acute nonthrombotic CNS manifestations may require pulse intravenous  cyclophosphamide. Plasmapheresis may also be added in patients with more severe  illness refractory to conventional treatment. Recently, the use of intrathecal  methotrexate and dexamethasone has been reported in a small series of patients,  with a good outcome in patients with severe CNS manifestations. Anticoagulation  is warranted in patients with thrombotic disease, particularly in those with the  antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This article reviews the clinical approach to  therapy in patients with CNS lupus.

T1  - Endothelium and the brain in CNS lupus.
SP  - 919-28
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  common and results in different clinical manifestations. Several pathogenic  mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in determining such a variety of  clinical symptoms. The thrombophilic state associated to the presence of  antiphospholipid antibodies has been suggested to be responsible for a  noninflammatory vasculopathy which causes clear ischaemic events as well as  alterations of the cerebral microcirculation that are likely associated to  seizures, cognitive dysfunction or psychosis. Although less frequent, a true  vasculitic process affecting cerebral circulation has also been reported. In both  cases, brain endothelium does represent the target of the pathogenic mechanisms.  Brain endothelial cells display peculiar functional and phenotypical  characteristics in comparison with endothelial cells from other anatomical  districts, raising the possibility that this might be the reason for its  susceptibility in lupus disease. We review and present data suggesting that a  higher and firmer expression of beta 2 glycoprotein I on endothelial cell  membranes can be responsible for a selective damage/activation by circulating  anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I, and that antiendothelial cell antibodies crossreact  with brain endothelium and in some cases, specifically bind brain endothelial  cells only in lupus patients with central nervous involvement.

T1  - Ribosomal P antibodies and CNS lupus.
SP  - 916-8
AB  - Within two years of the recognition of autoantibodies to ribosomal P proteins in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) an association with anti-P  autoantibodies with psychosis was noted. While there has been some controversy  about this association, ample evidence suggests a meaningful relationship between  anti-P antibodies and central nervous system (CNS) disease. This evidence  consists of 1) seven independent studies showing a strong relationship between  anti-P antibodies and CNS disease; 2) longitudinal studies showing fluctuations  of anti-P antibodies with episodes of psychosis; 3) correlation of anti-P  antibodies with general disease activity; and 4) acid eluates form lupus renal  tissue were found to contain anti-P antibodies enriched 30-fold with respect to  their specific activity in serum heralding a direct role of anti-P antibodies in  disease expression. Finally, there is evidence that the P protein resides on  normal cells in an immunologically accessible way and evidence exists that anti-P  antibodies are able to bind and penerate cells in culture, and once inside cells  can affect a profound inhibition of protein synthesis in living cells. Taken  together, these observations provide evidence linking anti-P antibodies to  various forms of CNS disease. While this is true, there are other autoantibodies  in SLE patients such as anti-dsDNA and antiglial fibrillary protein which may  also play a role in the CNS disease of SLE patients. Continued study will inform  us of the relative contribution of these autoantibodies to CNS disease in SLE  patients.

T1  - The blood-brain barrier in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 908-15
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) involvement may occur in 20-70% of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) patients where neurological symptoms are overt; this is  termed neuropsychiatric lupus or NPSLE. This review summarizes evidence that  damage to the brain endothelium forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a  contributory factor in NPSLE. The normal CNS is protected by blood-tissue  barriers at three sites, the brain endothelium (BBB), the choroid plexus  epithelium (blood-CSF barrier) and the arachnoid epithelium. The tight junctions  of the barrier layers severely restrict entry of plasma constituents including  proteins, so that the CSF and brain interstitial fluid contain low levels of  protein. Methods for diagnosing BBB damage include imaging (CT, MRI) using  contrast agents, and analysing protein content and profiles of CSF Changes in the  albumin quotient Qalbumin show evidence for barrier damage, while changes in the  immunoglobulin (Ig) index can indicate intrathecal antibody production. However,  BBB damage may be transient, and hence undetected or underestimated. Few  mechanistic studies exist, but the two main candidate mechanisms for BBB damage  are microthrombi in cerebral vessels leading to ischaemia, and immune-mediated  attack and activation of the endothelium leading to local cytokine production.  Both can result in barrier breakdown. Neurological syndromes could then be  secondary to damage to the BBB. The implications for treatment of NPSLE are  discussed.

T1  - Cognitive dysfunction and antiphospholipid antibodies in systemic lupus 
SP  - 883-90
AB  - Nervous system involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is typically  diagnosed on the basis of clinical psychiatric and/or neurologic syndromes  (NPSLE). Neuropsychological tests can be used to assess nervous system integrity  even in the absence of major NP syndromes. Their application has uncovered  significant cognitive dysfunction, ranging from mild to severe, in a sizeable  proportion of SLE patients irrespective of clinical NP status. Cognitive  dysfunction has now been accepted as a bona fide manifestation of NPSLE. The  heterogeneity of clinical NPSLE manifestations is paralleled by the diversity of  cognitive deficits reported in different studies and within different patients.  The success of attempts to explain these deficits on the basis of potential  pathogenetic mechanisms, such as antibrain antibodies and proinflammatory  cytokines, has been uneven. To date, the most robust findings have emerged in  relation to antiphospholipid antibodies, which carry with them important  therapeutic implications.

SP  - 877-82
AB  - Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) may present with neurological syndromes.  Cerebrovascular disease, chorea/ballismus, epileptic seizures, headache,  cognitive impairment, transverse myelopathy, Devic's syndrome and multiple  sclerosis-like presentations feature among others. Cerebrovascular disease is one  of the most common presenting symptoms of APS, second only to deep vein  thrombosis, and accounts for half of neurological manifestations in patients with  APS; accelerated atherogenesis and cardioembolism are the most likely mechanisms  implicated. Though infrequent, chorea is consistently associated with APS; the  pathogenetic role of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLab) in this case might be  routed through cerebrovascular disease in some cases and through purely  immunological pathways in others. Both ischemic and immunological mechanisms have  been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures, which may account  for 7% of neurological manifestations in APS. Although frequent in APS, a  causative link between APLab and most common types of headache (migraine and  tension-type headache) is more than dubious. Cognitive impairment may derive from  a well-defined clinical tableau of multi-infarct dementia. Nevertheless, (highly  frequent) less severe cognitive impairment has also been associated with the  presence of APLab in the absence of magnetic resonance findings. A relationship  between APS and transverse myelopathy seems likely but small numbers in the  studies published to date preclude definite statements; routinely testing for  APLab patients with neurological manifestations suggestive of multiple sclerosis  seems to be unrecommended at the present time.

T1  - Recent advances in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis: autoantibodies and B 
SP  - 564-8
AB  - Although many factors contribute to the clinical presentation and subsequent  course of individuals with lupus nephritis, the formation of glomerular immune  deposits is typically one of the initial events. In general, breakdown in  immunologic tolerance leads to the production of autoreactive B and T cells that,  either through direct infiltration and/or their secretory products, initiate  inflammation. Immune deposition within glomeruli results in complement activation  and recruitment of inflammatory cells, along with activation of endogenous renal  cells. This inflammatory cascade leads to secretion of cytokines and chemokines,  which in turn attract more infiltrating cells. Up-regulation of lymphoid-derived  chemokines further enhance the cellular influx, augmenting inflammation and  resulting in further tissue damage. The degree of inflammation is determined by  the extent of this invasion along with both the systemic and local responses to  the assault. This review focuses mainly on the contributions of pathogenic  autoantibodies, autoreactive B cells to lupus nephritis, and potential  immunologic therapies for lupus nephritis. Manipulation of both the cells and  soluble mediators that initiate and perpetuate the disease are essential to  suppressing autoreactivity and inflammation and preventing disease progression.

T1  - Etanercept-induced systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 604-7
AB  - Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine with a role in the  pathogenesis of a number of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis,  psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's disease. Etanercept  (Enbrel; Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA, USA) is a recombinant soluble fusion protein  of TNF-alpha type II receptor and IgG which acts by blocking the action of  TNF-alpha. It is licensed for use in rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile chronic  arthritis. A number of studies report the development of antinuclear and  anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies in patients treated with TNF antagonists for  rheumatoid arthritis. There are few reports of the development of clinical  features of discoid, subacute or systemic lupus erythematosus. We present one of  the first reported cases of etenercept-induced systemic lupus erythematosus and  review the literature of lupus and TNF antagonists.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a case 
SP  - 355-8
AB  - We describe a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed  severe and acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Detection of the  fragmentation of peripheral red blood cells (RBC) helped the early diagnosis of  TTP and the patient was rescued by extensive plasma exchange started promptly  after the diagnosis. Because manifestations of TTP are similar to those in SLE,  it is sometimes difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of TTP in SLE patients.  We emphasise here the significance of the early diagnosis of TTP by the  observation of fragmented RBC and the intensive therapy, including plasma  exchange, for this very severe condition.

SP  - 324-8
AB  - We report a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and secondary  Sjogren's syndrome (SS) who developed inclusion body myositis (IBM) which,  contrary to the typical presentation of this disorder, was symmetrical in nature  although the diagnosis was only made after electron microscopy was performed.  Therapy with increased doses of methotrexate proved to be beneficial, with the  patient having full recovery after 8 months of therapy. It appears that a subset  of IBM may be related to autoimmune disorders, an issue that was disputed in the  past, and these patients may have a better prognosis than typical IBM patients.  This is the first case report of IBM in a patient who had the dual diagnosis of  SLE and SS.

T1  - Diagnostic and prognostic significance of anti-C1q antibodies in systemic lupus 
SP  - 619-24
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The presence of a wide variety of autoantibodies is a  characteristic finding in systemic lupus erythematosus. Autoantibodies against  nuclear proteins, such as anti-nuclear and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies,  are used as diagnostic markers in systemic lupus erythematosus. Renal involvement  is frequently found in systemic lupus erythematosus and is an important risk  factor for death. Therefore, markers for the diagnosis and follow-up of nephritis  are very important. Anti-C1q autoantibodies are strongly associated with renal  involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus. This study will review recent  findings on the pathogenic role and clinical importance of anti-C1q antibodies in  lupus nephritis. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent clinical studies have clearly emphasized  the diagnostic relevance of anti-C1q autoantibody levels in patients with lupus  nephritis. With a possible negative predictive value of 100%, anti-C1q  autoantibodies are the only exclusive antibodies associated with the involvement  of a single organ in systemic lupus erythematosus. Next to the clinical findings,  the pathogenic significance of anti-C1q antibodies has been shown in an animal  model. The deposition of autologous C1q in healthy glomeruli of mice after the  infusion of anti-C1q antibodies induces moderate tissue damage. SUMMARY: The  latest insight into the pathogenesis of anti-C1q autoantibodies in the  development of lupus nephritis and the recently demonstrated clinical importance  of anti-C1q autoantibodies for the diagnosis of lupus nephritis support the value  of further investigations. New diagnostic methods for the detection of anti-C1q  and an accurate follow-up of antibody levels might be of use in clinical  practice.

T1  - [Cutaneous manifestations of internal diseases: purpura, livedo, pyoderma 
SP  - 1479-87
AB  - Dermatology and internal medicine have in common that many systemic diseases  manifest with skin symptoms that are easily accessible for both diagnostic and  investigative procedures. Even if modern practice of medicine tends towards organ  specific particularity of specialists, dermatology traditionally strives for  interdisciplinary communication. Cutaneous manifestations of internal diseases  present in various forms. In a syndrome, a number of symptoms present in an  identical pattern, and pattern recognition is diagnostic. Vice versa, a distinct  skin sign can be a clue to various internal disorders, that have to be considered  in the differential diagnosis. Purpura and livedo due to either inflammatory  (immune complex mediated or associated with ANCA) or vasoocclusive  microthrombotic vascular disease are presented as examples. Finally, subtile  variations in key symptoms of the skin, such as of pyoderma gangrenosum, may give  a clue to a specific underlying disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis,  inflammatory bowel disease, monoclonal gammopathy, or hematologic disease, as  exemplified by the variants of pyoderma gangrenosum.

T1  - Ethnic disparities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 364-9
AB  - Ethnic disparities in health care have been historically well documented, but  their causes still remain poorly explained. In the US, ethnic minorities have a  higher incidence and prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus and also  experience less favorable outcomes when compared with the Caucasian majority.  These discrepancies can be explained, at least in part, by genetic-related ethnic  factors; however, nongenetic factors emerging from differences in socioeconomic  status and related individual social (poverty, limited access to quality health  care) and cultural characteristics (inadequate health belief patterns, distrust  in medical institutions) are also likely to contribute to these discrepancies. A  comprehensive recognition of current unfavorable, but modifiable, circumstances  will provide the framework to develop strategic approaches toward eliminating  existent disparities in health, including those occurring in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus.

T1  - Polymorphic light eruption.
SP  - 28-39
AB  - Polymorphic light eruption (PMLE) is the most common photodermatosis. It is  typically characterized by nonscarring, pruritic, erythematous papules, plaques,  or vesicles on sun-exposed skin that develop 30 minutes to several hours after  sun exposure. The eruption may persist for a few hours to as long as 2 weeks.  Females are affected two to three times more often than males. PMLE has been  reported in all races, but tends to affect fair-skinned individuals with  Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV most commonly. The pathogenesis of PMLE has been  difficult to define, although it appears to be an immune-mediated delayed-type  hypersensitivity reaction. Abnormalities of arachidonic acid metabolism and a  possible correlation with lupus are other theories that are reviewed. Treatment  options have been explored extensively. While "hardening" or desensitization of  the skin through repeated irradiation seems to be the most effective, therapeutic  options such as sun avoidance/sun protection, oral carotenoids, and antimalarials  are also considered.

SP  - 354-9
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the autoimmune disease that most commonly  compromises pregnancy. Moreover, the relationship between SLE and pregnancy is in  both directions. However, in the recent years there has been a great change in  the perception of the effects of pregnancy on SLE flares and of SLE on pregnancy  outcome (both fetal and maternal). The current experience indicates that  pregnancy in patients with SLE should not be regarded as an unacceptable high  risk condition for the mother or her baby provided that careful planning of  conception and multidisciplinary monitoring and treatment are carried out.

SP  - 1452-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify preliminary core sets of outcome variables for disease  activity and damage assessment in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE)  and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). METHODS: Two questionnaire surveys were  mailed to 267 physicians from 46 different countries asking each member to select  and rank the response variables used when assessing clinical response in patients  with JSLE or JDM. Next, 40 paediatric rheumatologists from 34 countries met and,  using the nominal group technique, selected the domains to be included in the  disease activity and damage core sets for JSLE and JDM. RESULTS: A total of 41  response variables for JSLE and 37 response variables for JDM were selected and  ranked through the questionnaire surveys. In the consensus conference, domains  selected for both JSLE and JDM activity or damage core sets included the  physician and parent/patient subjective assessments and a global score tool.  Domains specific for JSLE activity were the immunological tests and the kidney  function parameters. Concerning JDM, functional ability and muscle strength  assessments were indicated for both activity and damage core sets, whereas serum  muscle enzymes were included only in the activity core set. A specific paediatric  domain called 'growth and development' was introduced in the disease damage core  set for both diseases and the evaluation of health-related quality of life was  advised in order to capture the influence of the disease on the patient  lifestyle. CONCLUSIONS: We developed preliminary core sets of measures for  disease activity and damage assessment in JSLE and JDM. The prospective  validation of the core sets is in progress.

It is estimated that 10-17% of  lupus patients present before the age of 16. SLE in children appears to have more  severe organ involvement than in adults. The outcome of childhood SLE has  improved during the last decade, but the morbidity remains high.

T1  - LDL-apheresis and immunoadsorption: novel methods in the treatment of renal 
SP  - v59-62
AB  - Plasma exchange was used for many years as the method of extracorporeal removal  of antibodies and/or immune complexes that may be involved in the pathogenesis of  renal diseases. Recently low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis and  immunoadsorption were also introduced into nephrological practice. LDL-apheresis,  designed originally as a rescue treatment for refractory hyperlipidaemia,  appeared also to be effective in certain glomerulopathies, resistant to other  treatment strategies. Similarly, immunoadsorption can be employed successfully in  the treatment of different nephropathies, of both immunological and  non-immunological pathogenesis. This method may also be effective as rescue  treatment in some cases of acute rejection and recurrence of certain  nephropathies after renal transplantation. The major advantage of both methods is  their increased selectivity compared with standard plasma exchange. In addition,  these techniques need no supplement fluid (namely fresh frozen plasma), which  allows for markedly increased efficacy of the treatment as well as substantial  reduction of infection risks.

T1  - The risk of pregnancy in patients with lupus nephritis.
SP  - 161-7
AB  - Since many women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are of child-bearing age  and have normal fertility, the clinician must often face many problems relating  to pregnancy in patients with lupus nephritis. These include the influence of  lupus nephritis on fetal outcome, obstetric complications, and the influence of  pregnancy on SLE. Studies published in the 1960s underlined the increased fetal  and maternal risk and recommended against pregnancy in lupus patients. The  prognosis for non-pregnant SLE active patients was also poor, making it difficult  to know whether pregnancy altered the prognosis of the disease. Recent  prospective studies indicate that the majority of lupus mothers can sustain  pregnancy without detrimental effects, providing that the pregnancy is planned  during the inactive phase of the disease. Nevertheless the fetal risk, although  progressively reduced during the last 40 years, continues to be higher than in  pregnancies of healthy women particularly in patients with antiphospholipid  antibodies.

T1  - [Biological monitoring of autoimmune diseases during pregnancy].
SP  - 151-6
AB  - This review focuses on auto-immune diseases which frequently affect women and can  have interactions with pregnancy: lupus erythematosus (LES), antiphospholipide  syndrome (SAPL), Sjogren's syndrome (GS), rheumatoid arthritis (PR) and  auto-immune thyroiditis. LES may flare at the end of a pregnancy and during  post-partum. Its biological monitoring during pregnancy is well established. SAPL  is at risk of sterility, prematurity, Hellp syndrome, eclampsia and  retroplacental hematoma. The main risk, actually risk is foetal loss by placental  ischemia, which has to be well known as 2 randomised studies have proven the  efficacy of treatments with aspirin +/- subcutaneous heparin. LES, GS and PR can  both be associated with anti SS-A +/- anti SS-B antibodies linked to a risk of  congenital auriculo-ventricular block, which is fortunately low (less than 5% of  the cases). Auto-immune thyroiditis are often revealed during pregnancy and may  be enhanced during the six first months of post-partum.

SP  - 12-20
AB  - Glomerular disease in the tropics differs considerably from that in temperate  climates and between the developed and the developing world. The prevalence and  pattern of glomerular disease in the tropics in turn varies widely in different  geographic regions and is influenced by environmental, nutritional, and  socioeconomic factors. Among the infective agents that have been identified as  contributing to an increased prevalence of glomerular disease in the tropics are  Plasmodium malaria, Schistsomiasis mansoni, Mycobacterium leprosy, and hepatitis  B virus (HBV). A decline in the prevalence can only be expected with the  eradication of infections. Accurate knowledge of the prevalence, histologic  features, and causes is essential to achieve prevention and management of  glomerular diseases in the tropics.

T1  - Immunotherapy in autoimmune diseases.
SP  - 702-6
AB  - Immunotherapy has the potential to modify or re-balance the immune system and  hence useful in the management of autoimmune conditions. This article aims to  review clinically useful immunotherapies available for treatment of autoimmune  conditions, with particular emphasis on Type I diabetes mellitus, multiple  sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. A Medline  search for the period 1992 to 2002 (10 years) using the unrestricted keywords  "immunotherapy AND autoimmune" was done. Full-length articles were selected for  reviews based on the contents of their published abstracts. Additional Medline  searches were focussed on the keywords "immunotherapy AND diabetes mellitus",  "immunotherapy AND multiple sclerosis", "immunotherapy AND rheumatoid arthritis",  and "immunotherapy AND systemic lupus erythematosus". Relevant publications  referenced in the reviewed literature were further included for review, if not  present in the original Medline search. Immunotherapy in Type I diabetes mellitus  has focussed on the induction of tolerance to beta cell antigens, and in multiple  sclerosis trials of anti-alpha 4 integrins and altered peptide ligand of myelin  basic protein (MBP 83-99) showed initial promising results. The use of  anti-cytokine therapy (anti-TNF alpha and IL-1Ra) in rheumatoid arthritis has  improved the quality of life of patients with refractory disease. The use of  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for in vivo B cells depletion and early trials of  autologous peripheral stem cell transplants represent additional immunomodulatory  treatment modalities for systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Better  understanding of autoimmune conditions and advances in the production of  humanized monoclonal antibodies, promises better immunotherapy in the near  future.

T1  - [Neuropsychiatric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus. Part 1: clinical 
SP  - 730-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is a frequent complication  of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) ranging from a subclinical to a severe  disabling disease. Neuropsychiatric manifestations have been described in 18-67%  of cases depending on the diagnostic criteria. The cerebral involvement may  precede the full-blown picture of SLE or may develop in the course of disease,  most frequently within the first 3 years. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Neuropsychiatric  manifestations in SLE comprise diffuse psychiatric symptoms, focal neurologic  symptoms, and the involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Numerous CNS  syndroms have been described: migraine, seizure, stroke, chorea, transverse  myelopathy, psychosis, mood disorders, acute confusional state, and cognitive  dysfunction. The diagnosis of cerebral involvement can be difficult and has to be  differentiated from neurologic complications which may be, for instance, due to  uremia, hypertension, drug toxicity, and infection. PATHOGENESIS: A large number  of etiopathophysiologic processes are involved: antineuronal antibodies,  antibodies against ribosimal P-protein, and cytokines have been implicated in the  pathogenesis of diffuse neuropsychiatric symptoms. Focal neurologic symptoms are  the consequence of vascular injury induced by circulating immune complex,  occlusive vasculopathy as a result of endothelial cell activation induced by  cytokines and complement activation, or macro- and microvascular thrombosis  induced by antiphospholipid antibodies. In the later stages of disease,  cerebrovascular manifestations are often related to accelerated atherosclerosis,  which is entertained by increased intravascular complement turnover and  antiphospholipid antibodies.

T1  - Pathogenesis and natural history of osteonecrosis.
SP  - 94-124
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) is a relatively  common disorder seen by both rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons. The vast  majority of cases are secondary to trauma. However, for non-traumatic cases,  there often remains a diagnostic challenge in defining the cause of bone death.  The goal of this article is to review data extensively in the medical literature  with respect to the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis, its natural history, and  treatment. METHODS: A review of 524 studies on osteonecrosis was performed, of  which 213 were selected and cited. RESULTS: Non-traumatic osteonecrosis has been  associated with corticosteroid usage, alcoholism, infections, hyperbaric events,  storage disorders, marrow infiltrating diseases, coagulation defects, and some  autoimmune diseases. However, a large number of idiopathic cases of osteonecrosis  have been described without an obvious etiologic factor. Although corticosteroids  can produce osteonecrosis, careful history is always warranted to identify other  risk factors. The pathogenesis of non-traumatic osteonecrosis appears to involve  vascular compromise, bone and cell death, or defective bone repair as the primary  event. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is now much better  defined and skeletal scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging have enhanced  diagnosis greatly. Early detection is important because the prognosis depends on  the stage and location of the lesion, although the treatment of femoral head  osteonecrosis remains primarily a surgical one. CONCLUSIONS: Osteonecrosis has  been associated with a wide range of conditions. Many theories have been proposed  to decipher the mechanism behind the development of osteonecrosis but none have  been proven. Because osteonecrosis may affect patients with a variety of risk  factors, it is important that caregivers have a heightened index of suspicion.  Early detection may affect prognosis because prognosis is dependent on the stage  and location of the disease. In particular, the disease should be suspected in  patients with a history of steroid usage, especially in conjunction with other  illnesses that predispose the patient to osteonecrosis. RELEVANCE: A better  understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of osteonecrosis  will help the physician determine which patients are at risk for osteonecrosis,  facilitating early diagnosis and better treatment options.

SP  - 85-91
AB  - From a cohort study of 349 Thai patients (337 females [F] and 12 males [M]) with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 52 patients (51 F, 1 M) died. Their 5- and  10-year survival rates were 84.0% and 74.9%, respectively. Seventy-nine percent  of deaths occurred within the first year of diagnosis. Infection contributed to  27 deaths (51.9%). The lung and the urinary system were the 2 most common sites  of infection. There were 18 SLE-related deaths (34.6%), and 7 non-SLE related  deaths (13.5%). In a multivariate analysis of all causes of death, serositis,  hematologic abnormality, central nervous system (CNS) and renal involvement were  significantly associated with poor survival, while photosensitivity and arthritis  were significantly associated with longer survival. Among SLE-related death,  serositis and CNS involvement were significantly associated with poor survival,  and arthritis was associated with longer survival. In conclusion, infection was  the most common cause of death in Thai SLE patients. CNS and visceral involvement  were associated with a poor outcome.

T1  - Malignancy and systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 351-8
AB  - The association of malignancy with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been  investigated for years. The findings of cohort studies lend support for an  increased risk of malignancy in SLE but are difficult to interpret definitively.  In addition, several cohort studies have suggested an increased risk of  non-Hodgkin's lymphoma but with imprecise estimation. There is inadequate  evidence for any conclusions about the risk of solid tumors in these patients. A  multicenter international research effort is in progress to elucidate these  issues and to establish the role of exposures such as cytotoxic or  immunomodulatory therapy. The recommendations advocated for cancer screening  policies and for minimizing known risk factors for cancer in the general  population should not be neglected in persons with SLE.

SP  - 345-50
AB  - The size of the known members of the tumor necrosis factor ligand and receptor  superfamilies has burgeoned in the past few years. Among the novel tumor necrosis  factor ligand and receptor superfamily members recently described is B lymphocyte  stimulator (BLyS; Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD) protein. By virtue of its  ability to promote B-cell survival, expansion, and differentiation, it likely  plays an important contributory role in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis  and propagation. In addition, it may play a similar role in other systemic  immune-based rheumatic diseases, and becomes a legitimate candidate target for  antagonist biologic agents.

T1  - Therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus: a look into the future.
SP  - S25-30
AB  - The prognosis for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus has greatly improved  over the past two decades. However, therapies that are more effective and that  have fewer sequelae are needed to rescue patients from organ failure and further  reduce mortality. Research under way, including that into induction of tolerance  to self-antigens, prevention of the consequences of pathogenic autoantibody  production, interference with the cytokine network and signal transduction, the  identification and treatment of any infectious triggers, and stem cell therapy,  offers hope of improved remedies or even of cure. Given the fact that a number of  biological therapies for rheumatologic disease are already in use or are in the  development stage, such progress may come soon.

AB  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus is associated with cutaneous lesions, CHB, hepatic  disease, and thrombocytopenia. IgG antibodies to Ro and/or La cross the placenta  and participate in the development of the clinical manifestations. Mothers of  babies with NLE are likely to develop collagen vascular diseases with time.  Infants with NLE are at risk to develop other autoimmune diseases during  childhood or adolescence.

T1  - Abetimus (La Jolla pharmaceuticals).
SP  - 234-9
AB  - La Jolla is developing abetimus (LJP-394), a tetrakis-oligonucleotide conjugate,  for the treatment of lupus and in particular, lupus kidney disease. In September  2000, phase III trials were initiated [382931]. These trials were ongoing in July  2001 [415284]. In January 1999, analysts had predicted a US filing in mid-2000  [318933]. The drug was granted Orphan Drug status in the US in September 2000 and  in the EU in November 2001 [381379], [431129]. Following a meeting with the FDA,  La Jolla planned a phase III trial of abetimus and expected this to begin in the  second half of 2000 [364916]. In September 2000, the company anticipated its  commencement within a few months [381379]; in fact, it began shortly thereafter.  The trial was designed to repeat the positive results from the phase II/III study  and the company intended to enroll 300 patients [382931], [386254]. By October  2000, more than ten clinical sites had been initiated into the trial and thefirst  patient had been dosed. The company planned to have more than 50 sites in North  America enrolling patients by the end of the year and expected to add about 15  more sites across Europe early in 2001 [384402]. In September 1996, US-05552391,  covering abetimus, was granted. In October 1996, the company announced that it  has received a third US composition of matter patent on abetimus [222901]. In  November 1997, the company was issued with broad patents covering its core  Tolerance Technology in 16 European countries and in Japan. A US patent on the  technology was issued in 1993. These patents cover toleragens, as any composition  of matter which contain multiple copies of B-cell epitopes, conjugated to a  multivalent platform, where the conjugates lack T-cell epitopes. The patents also  cover methods of synthesis and use [269583]. In November 2001, Morgan Keegan & Co  estimated sales to be US $150 million in 2003, rising to US $600 million in 2005  [439326].

T1  - Severe hypoalbuminaemia in a systemic lupus erythematosus-like patient.
SP  - 84-6
AB  - Diffuse oedema due to hypoalbuminaemia is a common manifestation in patients  affected with systemic lupus erythematosus. Hypoalbuminaemia is usually secondary  to an ongoing glomerulonephritis leading to proteinuria or, more rarely, to  decreased protein synthesis or deficient protein intake. Here, we report the case  of a 6-year-old girl with a previous history of Evans' syndrome and mesangial  glomerulonephritis who subsequently developed severe anasarca without apparent  proteinuria. Faecal oal-antitrypsin showed a persistent severe intestinal protein  loss (ranging from 1500 to 6.500 yl/g humid faeces, normal value < 200),  consistent with the diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy. An echographic  examination of the abdomen revealed a diffuse thickening of the intestinal wall,  particularly at the level of the small bowel, with an almost exclusive  involvement of the submucosal layer. Colonoscopy revealed the presence of diffuse  purpuric lesions at the level of the submucosa. Aggressive immunosuppressive  treatment completely resolved the clinical picture. CONCLUSION: protein-losing  enteropathy is an uncommon cause of hypoalbuminaemia during the course of  systemic lupus erythrematosus. It may be considered as a clinical syndrome  related to many pathological conditions leading to an excessive intestinal  protein loss. Some conditions are related with an altered mucosal permeability,  others with primary or secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia. A review of the  possible causes of systemic lupus erythrematosus-associated protein-losing  enteropathy reported in the paediatric literature is given.

T1  - Dehydroepiandrosterone for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 23-31
AB  - The adrenal steroidal hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been studied as a  potential pharmacological agent in the treatment of the autoimmune disease  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Both the endocrine effects (the ability to be  converted peripherally to androgenic and oestrogenic sex steroids) and the  immunomodulatory effects of DHEA (the production of the Th(1) cytokines, such as  IL-2) suggest that this hormone could be of benefit for patients with SLE. During  the past decade, five controlled clinical trials and a number of additional  observational studies have been performed investigating these possibilities. The  results from these studies suggest that 200 mg/day of DHEA for 7 - 12 months  decreases corticosteroid requirement for the patients, the frequency of disease  flares, has an anti-osteoporotic effect and has an overall beneficial effect on  SLE disease activity in female patients. A small study suggested benefits for  cognitive function in such patients. The side effects acne and hirsutism were  seen relatively frequently (30 - 40% and 10 - 12% of patients, respectively) but  in most instances were deemed mild. DHEA treatment resulted in changes in lipid  profile and may have endocrine effects, the consequences of which will need to be  ascertained through longer-term follow-up studies.

SP  - 476-80
AB  - Necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenopathy (NHL) is a rarely observed clinical  entity that is occasionally associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  The histological features of the condition have been considered to be  indistinguishable from those of lymphadenitis in subjects with SLE, and the  clinical symptoms of the two disorders share common features. This report  presents the case history of a subject who developed SLE with central nervous  system involvement 3 years following onset of Kikuchi's disease (histiocytic  necrotizing lymphadenitis). Repeated lymph node biopsies confirmed the diagnosis  in relation to the clinical progression. A review of the literature on this topic  is also presented.

T1  - Pregnancy and lupus nephritis.
SP  - 319-27
AB  - Family planning and pregnancy are important and usually problematic issues for a  young woman with lupus nephritis. Moderate renal insufficiency and previous use  of alkylating cytotoxic drugs are associated with decreased fertility. Oral  contraceptives containing synthetic estrogens are contraindicated in women with  active lupus nephritis, uncontrolled hypertension, history of thromboembolic  diseases or high levels of antiphospholipid antibodies. Mild flares of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) are common during pregnancy, severe renal flares and  permanent impairment of renal function are uncommon. The outlook of pregnancy for  women with lupus nephritis is usually favourable if the disease (both renal and  nonrenal) has been quiescent for at least 6 months before pregnancy, and if, at  conception, serum creatinine is less than 140 micromol/l, proteinuria less than 3  g/24 h and blood pressure controlled. The risk of fetal loss is, however, at  least 2-3 times higher than in the normal population and pre-eclampsia,  prematurity and fetal growth retardation frequently complicate these pregnancies.  Especially poor fetal outcome is associated with antiphospholipid antibodies.  Pregnancies in women with lupus nephritis require intense fetal and maternal  surveillance.

T1  - Neonatal lupus: clinical features, therapy, and pathogenesis.
SP  - 391-5
AB  - Neonatal lupus is a disease characterized by one or more of the following  findings: congenital heart block, cardiomyopathy, cutaneous lupus lesions,  hepatobiliary disease, and thrombocytopenia. Accumulating evidence indicates that  the disease is probably caused by maternal autoantibodies, particularly  autoantibodies of the Ro family. While often initially asymptomatic, mothers tend  to develop symptoms of connective tissue disease. This review discusses the  recent advances in the understanding of neonatal lupus, its clinical features,  therapy, and pathogenesis.

AB  - The results of prospective large cohort studies of patients with different  clinical subsets of APS have been reported recently. A significant impact of the  disease on long-term survival has been documented in these studies. Cumulative  irreversible damage secondary to thrombosis results in organ dysfunction and  morbidity. To assess prognosis and treatment in APS, it is imperative to quantify  damage. We have recently created and validated an Antiphospholipid Damage Index,  which is currently undergoing improvements. Having APS, whether primary or  secondary, definitely confers a poor prognosis.

SP  - 177-202
AB  - Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a malignant vascular neoplasia with a viral etiology,  characterized by development of multiple hyperpigmentate lesions, primarily at  cutaneous level with associated edema and ulcerations, but frequently involving  also the mucous membranes and/or visceral organs. In this study, we describe (in  the light of the relevant literature) the clinical case of an elderly (78  yrs-old) woman, who developed red-blues multiple hyperkeratotic nodules in the  right leg and foot with marked lymphoedema, blushing and pain, after a long  period of a low-dose corticosteroid therapy for LES (at least 10 years of  continuous treatment). The diagnosis of KS was made on the basis of histologic  findings. The patient HLA-typing showed the haplotypes HLA-A2-10, -B21-35,  -Bw4-6, -Cw4 and HLA-DR11-13 (some of which are known to predispose to LES, but  not to KS). The KS, first described by Moritz Kaposi in 1872, has been a very  rare pathology until the 80s, afterwards its frequency has steadly increased,  favored by immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune diseases or tranplants and by  immunodepression of AIDS. Concerning the pathogenesis, it is crucial the role of  HHV-8 of the herpesvirus family (found in the lesions and in the circulating  cells of all KS patients), for which a prevailing sexual transmission is  postulated. General physicians and specialists of internal medicine and angiology  should know this disease, which can be undiagnosed because of the low incidence  in the general population and the consequent poor knowledge of this vascular  neoplastic disease, which is now reported with increasing frequency.

SP  - 475-84
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thymoma is a tumour originating in the epithelial cells of the  thymus, associated with several immunologic disorders. The association of thymoma  with systemic lupus erythematosus has rarely been described. We report two cases  of this association. EXEGESIS: Description of two cases and a review of the  literature. Mr T. was 41 years old when the diagnosis of thymoma and lupus was  made. The thymectomy did not influence the evolution of his lupus. Mrs G. had  been treated because of a lupus for 8 years prior to developing a thymoma. One  year later she presented with erythroblastopenia, which was only sensitive to  cyclosporin. CONCLUSION: The association between lupus and thymoma has been  reported in 36 cases in the literature. Thymoma is benign in 59% of the cases.  The clinical presentation of lupus is nonspecific except for age, median 48  years, and sex ratio, 4:3. The clinical outcome of the lupus is not influenced by  the thymectomy. Thymoma may precede lupus with a delay of several years or it may  be diagnosed concurrently or several years later. This association is not  accidental, though the pathogenic link between these conditions remains unknown.  One could suppose that the decrease of the thymic function in the course of  thymoma could enhance the expression of autoreactive T lymphocytes as well as the  activation of B cells. Patients should be followed after thymectomy because  autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus, may develop belatedly. On the other  hand, thymoma may be suspected mainly when lupus occurs in patients around 50  years of age.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric lupus.
SP  - 205-12
AB  - Neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have  been recognized for more than 100 years but continue to pose a diagnostic and  therapeutic challenge for rheumatologists and other physicians involved in the  care of SLE patients. NP-SLE includes a plethora of clinical manifestations and  the reported prevalence has varied widely between 14% and 75%. The recent  introduction of a standard nomenclature, case definitions, and diagnostic  criteria for 19 NP-SLE syndromes should facilitate a more consistent approach to  the classification of patients and to the execution of large multicenter clinical  studies. The etiology of NP-SLE is likely multifactorial and includes  microangiopathy, autoantibody production, and the intrathecal production of  proinflammatory cytokines. Newer imaging modalities of brain structure and  function provide novel ways of understanding pathogenic mechanisms. The use of  standardized neuropsychometric techniques to evaluate cognitive function has  identified a high prevalence of cognitive impairment in SLE patients. The  management of patients with NP-SLE includes symptomatic and immunosuppressive  therapies, evidence for which is largely limited to uncontrolled clinical trials  and anecdotal experience. Multicenter initiatives are required to address  important issues on prognosis and management.

SP  - 127-30
AB  - The future promises good news for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus,  some of which can already be foreseen. Increased knowledge on genes that  participate in the predisposition, pathogenesis, pharmacogenetics of, and  protection against this disease may permit intervention at this level. Also,  better understanding about the role of sex hormones has allowed trials of weak  androgens or prolactin inhibitors. New immunomodulators or immunosuppressors may  enable more precise treatment at the immunoregulatory level, and greater  knowledge on the disturbance of circuits has already provided hints and even  allowed trials of anti-interleukin-10 antibodies, an IL-10 decreasing agent,  tolerance-induction strategies or intervention at the level of T cell  co-stimulation, as well as immune ablation with subsequent stem cell  transplantation. Autoantibodies can be removed, controlled by means of  anti-idiotypes, which are blocked from reaching their target antigen or uncoupled  from the tissues they have reached. All these treatment strategies will gradually  become decanted in order to achieve the optimal treatment of SLE, which may tum  out to be its cure.

SP  - 47-52
AB  - Severe mitral valve regurgitation due to systemic lupus erythematosus is a rare  cause of valvular heart disease, necessitating valve surgery. Currently, there  are 36 case reports in the world medical literature of mitral valve replacement  or repair in patients who have lupus. The current trend in mitral valve surgery  is toward anatomic valve repair. In patients who have systemic lupus  erythematosus, however, valve repair often leads to repeat surgery and valve  replacement. We report the cases of 5 patients with lupus and severe mitral valve  regurgitation who underwent mitral valve surgery. In 3 of these patients,  replacement with a mechanical prosthetic mitral valve was performed with good  long-term results. In the other 2 patients, mitral valve repair was performed,  but only 1 of the repairs was successful. The 2nd patient required subsequent  replacement with a mechanical valve. To our knowledge, this report of 5 patients  is the largest series of mitral valve surgery in patients with lupus. These  results, along with a review of the literature, suggest the superiority of  mechanical prosthetic valve replacement to repair in patients who have systemic  lupus erythematosus.

SP  - 1027-32
AB  - This review covers major advances in clinical issues related to systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) published between 1995 and 2000. The classification criteria  for both SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) have been updated, and up to 19  different subsets of neuropsychiatric lupus have been defined. New  epidemiological data show that the incidence of new cases and the survival of  patients with SLE are both increasing. Several randomised controlled trials have  defined the role of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, antimalarials, and hormonal  treatment in the management of SLE. New data are available for drugs such as  ciclosporin and thalidomide. Finally, several new treatments for severe  refractory cases, such as mycophenolate mofetil and stem-cell transplantation,  are being increasingly used. New data also refer to management of thrombosis in  APS and high-risk pregnancies in women with SLE or APS.

Different forms of glomerulonephritis can occur in  patients with SLE and can contribute significantly to the associated morbidity  and, ultimately, mortality from the disease. Over the past two decades, there  have been significant strides in our understanding of the disease and in  treatments that attempt to control the formation and deposition of anti-DNA  auto-antibodies and immune complexes, as well as the subsequent inflammatory  cascade mediated through various cellular and humoral pathways leading to  progressive renal damage and end-stage renal disease. In this chapter, we review  the current understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of lupus nephritis in  its various stages and discuss the experimental and human data regarding some of  the potential newer forms of therapy. We discuss data regarding the use of  steroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil,  gammaglobulin, plasmapheresis, LJP 394, flaxseed oil, bindarit, anti-CD40 ligand,  and CTLA4Ig.

AB  - Our understanding of the immune system in health and disease has greatly  increased over this past decade. An outgrowth of this burgeoning knowledge has  been the discovery of novel strategies to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases.  As a result, significant advances have been made in the treatment of arthritis  with a half-dozen new treatments approved between September, 1998 and November,  1999. Although no new therapies have been approved for the treatment of systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE), this decade has witnessed an unprecedented amount of  activity in drug development for this disease. This article specifically  addresses the current status of drug development in the area of hormonal and  biologic therapies for SLE.

T1  - Atherosclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 19-23
AB  - The description of late-stage mortality and morbidity has been an important  contribution to the understanding of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the  past decade. Among the major factors in this clinical spectrum of SLE is the  development of accelerated atherosclerosis. This condition has been recognized  clinically with the documentation of myocardial infarction and angina in young  women with SLE. This accelerated atherosclerosis has also been recognized at  postmortem examinations. The exact mechanism for accelerated atherosclerosis  remains unclear. However, disease activity with its immunologic events, the  anticardiolipin syndrome, and the effect of corticosteroids in promoting  hyperlipidemia contribute to its development. It appears that SLE may be a risk  factor, in addition to the usual risk factors for the development of  atherosclerosis. It has recently been shown that antimalarials may prevent some  of the hyperlipidemia caused by corticosteroids. As evidence for the presence of  subclinical atherosclerosis in these patients is accumulating, earlier diagnosis  and treatment of events may be possible, and preventive measures may be  instituted earlier.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and collaborative management.
SP  - 199-204, 209-11
AB  - Lupus nephritis (LN) is a complex disease. The pathophysiology involves the  glomerulus and mesangium, and its manifestations are exhibited in extensive renal  lesions. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a classification  system to assist clinicians in understanding the severity of renal involvement.  The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and LN can be difficult  because of their often vague symptoms and the long list of differential  diagnoses. However, it is important to identify LN quickly to have an impact on a  patient's prognosis. The 11 criteria established by the American Rheumatology  Association provide a framework for identifying clinical manifestations of SLE.  Management of LN, which may be guided by renal biopsy findings, includes  pharmacologic therapy, management of drug toxicities, dialysis, transplantation,  controlling symptoms (e.g., hypertension), patient education, and psychosocial  support for the patient and family. This article focuses on the pathophysiology,  diagnostic approach, and collaborative management of LN.

AB  - The objective of this study was to document the experiences in the first Dutch  pilot studies of the effect of transplantation of autologous haematopoietic stem  cells in patients with therapy-resistant autoimmune disease. The first results in  21 adults and 14 children are promising: remission of the disease was achieved in  13 patients, while in the others a significant reduction of disease activity was  seen with a corresponding improvement of the quality of life. Infectious  complications were frequently observed. Two children with systemic juvenile  idiopathic arthritis developed a fatal infection-associated macrophage activation  syndrome. Multicentre randomised studies are necessary to study the effects of  autologous stem cell transplantation and modifications such as T-cell depletion.

T1  - Pulmonary capillaritis.
SP  - 430-5
AB  - Vasculitis, inflammation, and necrosis of blood vessels can involve any size or  type of vessel in the pulmonary vasculature, including the capillaries, so-called  capillaritis. Although pulmonary capillaritis is a histopathologic diagnosis that  is not pathognomonic of a specific disorder, it usually signals the presence of  an underlying systemic vasculitis or collagen vascular disease. Patients with  pulmonary capillaritis usually present with bilateral infiltrates on chest  radiographs and can be acutely ill with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that may be  life threatening. Therapy depends on diagnosis of the underlying disease that  gave rise to the capillaritis. Since many of the disorders leading to  capillaritis are treated by immunosuppression with corticosteroids and  cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, infection must be excluded early in the course  of therapy.

T1  - Interstitial lung disease in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 424-9
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) is a heterogenous disease of unknown etiology.  It is not uncommon to see pleuropulmonary involvement in isolation or along with  the involvement of other organ systems in SLE. Pulmonary manifestations of SLE  can involve the pleura, lung parenchyma, airways, pulmonary vasculature, and the  respiratory muscles. In this review we discuss two important pulmonary  manifestations of SLE: acute lupus pneumonitis and diffuse interstitial lung  disease. These two conditions have a major impact on the mortality and morbidity  of patients with SLE and it is essential to recognize and treat them  appropriately. High-resolution computed tomographic scans of the chest and  pulmonary function tests help to establish a diagnosis and aid long-term  follow-up of these patients. High-dose corticosteroids are the mainstay of  treatment for the two conditions, although other agents such as cyclophosphamide,  azathioprine, intravenous gamma globulin, and plasmapheresis have been used with  varying degrees of success.

T1  - Cyclosporine for lupus membranous nephritis: experience with ten patients and 
SP  - 241-51
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The treatment of lupus membranous nephritis (LMN), a lupus subset  that carries a high morbidity, is unsatisfactory. We report our experience in  treating LMN with the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CYS). METHODS: We  treated 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus fulfilling ACR criteria  with CYS for at least 12 months and followed renal function, serologic activity  and SLEDAI scores. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: 8 females, 2 males, 50% Caucasian,  mean age 37.3 y (range 22-48), disease duration 108.7 months (range 16-216),  nephritis duration 35.5 months (range 12-59), date of biopsy to date of starting  treatment 10.7 months (range 0-90). The patients were started on CYS with a mean  dose of 3.8 mg/kg (range 2.2-6) and followed for a mean duration of 24.8 months  (range 12-59). A Medline search identified all patients with lupus who were given  CYS or had LMN in articles from 1966-1999. RESULTS: Proteinuria improved from a  baseline mean of 5,588mg/24h (range 2,712-11,055) to 1,404 mg/24 h (range <  150-2,652). Serum albumin increased from a baseline mean of 2.8 g/100 ml (range  1.31-3.8) to a mean of 3.9 g/100 ml (range 3-4.5) at last follow-up. There was no  significant change in lupus activity as measured by SLEDAI. Nephrotoxicity was  common as evidenced by an increase in serum creatinine but it returned to  baseline with adjustment of the dose of CYS (20% decrease in the dose of CYS for  a 20% increase in serum creatinine). More antihypertensive medications were  required to control the blood pressure in these ten patients at the end of the  study compared to the onset (total number= 13 versus 6). CONCLUSION: Proteinuria  and serum albumin improved in all patients on CYS. A literature review is  consistent with this. Controlled studies of the use of CYS for membranous lupus  nephritis would be useful.

T1  - The shrinking lungs syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 467-72
AB  - A comprehensive review of the literature on shrinking lungs syndrome (SLS) in  systemic lupus erythematosus involved a MEDLINE search (1965-1997) of case  reports and clinical series of patients with the diagnosis of SLS. A total of 49  well-documented cases of SLS were reviewed. Shrinking lungs syndrome is  characterized by unexplained dyspnea, a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function  test results, and an elevated hemidiaphragm. The cause of SLS remains  controversial, with several authors attributing the disorder to diaphragmatic  weakness and others suggesting that chest wall restriction accounts for the  clinical syndrome. No definitive therapy exists. Corticosteroids have been  reported to lessen symptoms and improve pulmonary function in some patients with  SLS, but other methods of treatment have occasionally been found to be helpful.  Clinical presentation, method of diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment  modalities are summarized in this review. An uncommon complication of systemic  lupus erythematosus, SLS causes significant morbidity and, occasionally,  mortality.

T1  - Lupus nephritis in children.
SP  - 215-23
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with varied clinical  manifestations. Children and adolescents comprise one-fourth of affected patients  with SLE and 40-80% of them have renal involvement. Lupus nephritis (LN) may  present with mild urinary abnormalities or fulminant acute nephritis and renal  failure. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (WHO class IV) is the  predominant histological presentation in children and more common in boys than  girls. This probably is one of the main reasons for the high mortality reported  in the initial studies. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment have led to  improvement prognosis in these children. Cytotoxic therapy including intravenous  cyclophosphamide has a definite role in the management WHO class IV and  occasionally class III lupus nephritis. Prolonged steroid and cytotoxic therapy  may lead to significant toxicity.

T1  - Pulmonary renal syndrome in childhood: a report of twenty-one cases and a review 
SP  - 382-8
AB  - In adults, the term specific pulmonary renal syndrome describes disorders with  pulmonary and glomerular manifestations and includes Wegener's granulomatosis,  Goodpasture disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Nonspecific pulmonary  renal syndrome refers to either pulmonary disease complicating glomerular  disease, or glomerular diseases following pulmonary disease. Since little is  known regarding pulmonary renal syndrome in childhood, we reviewed the charts of  21 pediatric patients with pulmonary renal syndromes treated by the Department of  Pediatrics, University of Bern between 1991 and 1998; we also reviewed the  pediatric literature that deals with specific pulmonary renal syndromes. Specific  pulmonary renal syndrome was noted in 3 children with systemic vasculitis  (Wegener granulomatosis, N = 2; microscopic polyangiitis, N = 1) and 2 with  systemic lupus erythematosus. Nonspecific pulmonary renal syndrome was observed  in 12 patients with pulmonary edema (N = 9), pulmonary thromboembolism (N = 2),  and pulmonary infection (N = 1) complicating the course of a glomerular disease,  and in 4 children with a pulmonary disease followed by a glomerular disease.  Review of the literature disclosed 52 cases of specific pulmonary renal syndrome  other than systemic lupus erythematosus: Wegener granulomatosis (N = 28),  Goodpasture disease (N = 13), and Henoch-Schonlein purpura (N = 11). In addition,  hemolytic uremic syndrome complicated pneumococcal pneumonia in 32 cases. We  conclude that pulmonary renal syndromes need to be looked for in childhood. Apart  from Wegener granulomatosis, Goodpasture disease, and systemic lupus  erythematosus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura and hemolytic-uremic syndrome  occasionally have both pulmonary and renal features.

AB  - Over the past decade cyclophosphamide has come to assume an increasingly  prominent role in the management of severe, life-threatening manifestations of  SLE. Intermittent, intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide has become the standard of  treatment of diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis (WHO Class IV), and there is  now substantial clinical literature to suggest an indication for intermittent  cyclophosphamide therapy in most other forms of serious lupus affecting major  organ systems, in particular lupus vasculitis and acute central nervous system  manifestations. This update reviews the use of cyclophosphamide in the management  of lupus nephritis, expands on its role in other manifestations of SLE, and  discusses potential complications of the drug.

T1  - Antiphospholipid (Hughes) syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 331-48
AB  - APS is found in 20% to 35% of patients with SLE. PAPS and secondary APS have  similar features and aPL specificities. The clinical course of the secondary  syndrome is independent of the activity and severity of lupus, but the presence  of APS worsens the prognosis of patients with lupus. Some features of SLE may  result from thrombosis in patients with APS; thus, these patients require  anticoagulation rather than corticosteroids. Novel preliminary classification  criteria for APS were formulated during a postconference workshop held in  Sapporo, Japan, following the Eight International Symposium on Antiphospholipid  Antibodies. Treatment of APS remains empirical because of limited controlled  prospective data. There is strong evidence that patients with aPL-associated  thrombosis are subject to recurrences and require prophylactic therapy. APS is a  treatable cause of recurrent fetal loss in women with SLE. The treatment of  choice is anticoagulation with heparin, either standard unfractionated heparin or  LMWH. One of the main reasons for the improving outcomes in APS pregnancies is  closer obstetric surveillance.

T1  - A quantitative approach to the determination of antigen in immune complexes.
SP  - 1-17
AB  - Immune complexes are present in the circulation of healthy individuals and the  formation of such complexes is part of a normal immune process. During some  pathological conditions, significant amounts of immune complexes are formed and  deposited in the kidney and other tissues, causing severe injury. Since the  levels of immune complexes can provide valuable prognostic information, dozens of  methods have been developed to detect and quantify these complexes. However, many  of these methods are non-specific, not quantitative, and give false-positive  results. Methods based on detecting the antigen portion of immune complexes can  yield more precise information about circulating immune complexes. We have used a  quantitative dot-blot assay, which permits detection of antigen even if buried,  to determine the levels of antigen in circulating immune complexes. In healthy  donors, significant amounts of immune complexes containing DNA and  beta(2)-glycoprotein I were detected (natural immune complexes). Natural immune  complexes with Lewis X antigen were also observed in the circulation of healthy  persons. In experimentally induced murine systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and  SLE patients, there was a correlation between the clinical manifestations and the  levels of DNA in the circulating immune complexes. At severe SLE flares, the  level of DNA in circulating immune complexes decreased, probably due to tissue  deposition of immune complexes. The low levels of DNA in immune complexes  circulating in SLE patients correlated with low serum concentrations of the  complement component C1q. No direct correlation was found between the levels of  circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies and DNA in immune complexes. Thus, quantitation  of antigen levels in circulating immune complexes can be used to determine the  prognosis of autoimmune diseases.

SP  - 42-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the etiologies of urinary bladder involvement in  patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the clinicoradiologic features  of gastrointestinal tract manifestations and clinical outcomes in patients with  lupus cystitis accompanied by gastrointestinal manifestations. METHODS: We  conducted a retrospective chart review on 413 patients with SLE. Patients were  selected for review on the basis of lower urinary tract symptoms including  urinary frequency, urgency and urinary incontinence. Radiologic studies were  analyzed in patients with lupus cystitis. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients,  complicated with lower urinary tract symptoms, were identified. Underlying  etiologies were as follows: lupus cystitis in five, neurogenic dysfunction  secondary to transverse myelitis in three, cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in  one and tuberculous cystitis in one patient. All patients with lupus cystitis  showed gastrointestinal manifestations, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting  and/or diarrhea during the periods of cystitis symptoms. In all patients with  lupus cystitis, paralytic ileus was demonstrated on plain abdominal X-ray and  ascites, bilateral hydroureteronephrosis and thickened bladder wall were  identified on abdominal ultrasound or CT. Abdominal CT revealed bowel wall  thickening in four of the five patients. The main sites of thickened bowel on  abdominal CT were territory supplied by superior mesenteric artery. Two of five  patients with lupus cystitis expired during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION:  Diverse etiologies may cause lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with SLE.  Lupus cystitis is strongly associated with gastrointestinal involvement and  abdominal CT can be a useful radiologic tool to investigate the gastrointestinal  tract involvement in patients with lupus cystitis.

SP  - 55-60
AB  - EXACERBATIONS DURING PREGNANCY: Clinical and experimental data have clearly  evidenced the influence of hormones on the course of systemic lupus  erythematosus. In prospective studies of pregnant women, an exacerbation is  observed in 57% to 60% of the cases. It can be severe in 10% of the cases and  occur in the post partum in 7%. For most patients, the exacerbation is moderate  and has no unfavorable effect on the outcome of pregnancy. In case of renal  involvement, it is difficult to differentiate an intricated HELPP syndrome.  MARKERS AND RISK FACTORS: Low complement and elevated anti-DNA levels are  distinctive markers. Earlier renal involvement and hypertension are important  prognostic factors, particularly when the lupus begins during pregnancy. However,  when serum creatinine is lower than 100 mumol/l at pregnancy onset in patients in  remission, pregnancy does not alter renal function. An association with  antiphospholipid antibodies increases the risk for the fetus and the kidney  function. TREATMENT: Optimal treatment remains to be defined. Commonly, patients  are given aspirin, heparin in case of a history of thromboembolism, or both. The  rate of success currently exceeds 70%. The risk of thromboembolism in the peri or  post partum period requires anticoagulant treatment. Outside pregnancy: Ovulation  induction raises two risks: triggering a lupus flare-up and thrombosis,  particularly for patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. The influence of  menopause and hormone replacement therapy remains poorly understood.

T1  - Transverse myelopathy in systemic lupus erythematosus: an analysis of 14 cases 
SP  - 120-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To give a comprehensive review of transverse myelopathy (TM), a rare  but serious condition reported in 1-2% of patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: 14 patients with SLE and TM were evaluated and 91  additional cases published in the English and German literature reviewed.  RESULTS: TM presented either as the initial manifestation or within five years of  the diagnosis of SLE. Most patients presented with a detectable sensory deficit  at the thoracic level. In our 14 patients, 22% of the patients showed complete  neurological recovery, whereas in the total patient population of 105 (our cases  plus those reviewed in the literature), complete recovery was observed in 50%,  partial recovery in 29% and no improvement or deterioration in 21%. Treatment  with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by cyclophosphamide seemed to be  most effective. Seventy per cent of the total patient population had abnormal  magnetic resonance imaging findings. In our group of 14 patients, those with  higher disease activity (measured by the SLAM) at onset of TM were treated more  aggressively (for example, with plasmapheresis and intravenous pulse  cyclophosphamide). TM in our patients was associated with antiphospholipid  antibodies in 43% of the cases as compared with 64% of the total patient  population. Optic neuritis occurred in 48% of the total patient population with  SLE and TM, suggesting an association. CONCLUSIONS: TM in SLE is a poorly  understood entity. Outcome might be more favourable than previously suggested.  There is an association of TM with antiphospholipid antibodies in SLE patients.  Treatment including intravenous cyclophosphamide may improve the final outcome.  This report emphasises the need for multicentre trials to establish guidelines  for optimal treatment.

AB  - The severity of renal disease in systemic lupus erythematosus is variable. Renal  biopsy is important to guide the treatment. The World Health Organization  classification define six different histological categories with possible  transformations from one category to another. Histological signs of activity or  chronicity are important with respect to prognosis and treatment. Examination of  renal biopsy allows predicting the reversibility of histological lesions  following therapy. Apart from histological signs of severity, other factors may  influence the prognosis: arterial hypertension, initial serum creatinine, the  delay between onset of renal disease and treatment, the occurrence of  exacerbations of the nephropathy, and the response to therapy by the end of the  first year. The prognosis of severe forms of lupus nephritis, mainly diffuse  proliferative glomerulonephritis, has improved during the last 20 years. The  addition of immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine) to  corticosteroids is responsible for this improvement. Methylprednisolone pulses  are as effective as oral high doses of prednisone during initial treatment and  have fewer side effects. Many authors advocate monthly cyclophosphamide pulses  over six months, sometimes followed by quarterly pulse cyclophosphamide. However,  such an approach has not been proven to be more effective than an oral course of  cyclophosphamide and/or azathioprine. On follow-up, steroid therapy should be  slowly tapered, and close monitoring of lupus serological parameters (anti-DNA  antibodies, complement), urinary protein excretion rate, urinary sediment and  renal function allow one to detect exacerbations of the disease, which may  require adapted therapy. While such protocols have improved the outcome, they  have potential side effects. In addition to the deleterious effect of steroids on  physical appearance, often badly tolerated by adolescents, immunosuppressive  treatments increase the risks of severe infectious complications and the risks of  cardiovascular complications in young adults.

T1  - Autoantibodies in SLE. Disease associations.
SP  - 141-5
AB  - Antinuclear antibodies are an almost universal feature of SLE. Over the years  they have been the subject of intensive study to understand the underlying  pathogenesis of the disease. It is clear that ANA in the context of lupus are  directed against highly selected targets and are not just the result of  nonspecific polyclonal B cell activation. Frequently they react with components  of nucleoprotein complexes involved in important cellular processes which are  very specific targets for autoimmunity in this condition. The antibodies  themselves belong primarily to the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses of immunoglobulin,  are high affinity, occur in large amounts, have important associations with  particular HLA class II genes and show all the features of an antigen-driven, T  cell-dependent immune response. Although at first glance there is a wide range of  antibody specificities associated with SLE, in the individual patient the  autoantibody profile is much more restricted. Methods to detect these antibodies  have provided the clinician with valuable tools to assist both in diagnosis and  assessment of lupus patients. It has been possible to recognise distinctive  serological subsets within the spectrum of lupus which are associated with  certain patterns of disease expression. This can be helpful in determining both  disease classification and prognosis.

T1  - [Pregnancy and systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 408-18
AB  - Acute disseminated lupus erythematosus primarily affects young women. The highly  unfavorable influence of sex hormones is well known and women are advised against  pregnancy. Therapeutic termination of pregnancy has been considered necessary.  Regular progress in patient management has however completely changed the short,  mid and long-term prognosis, although severe forms still resist treatment. As  life expectancy improves, better disease control would allow revisiting the  possibility of pregnancy. The spontaneous risk of an acute flare-up during  pregnancy is debated but estimated in the 60% range. The risk would be about the  same whatever the term, but some suggest risk predominates in the third trimester  or in the post partum period. The risk of spontaneous abortion is high, partly  due to poor disease control and/or the presence of an associated antiphopholipid  syndrome. In such cases, preventive therapy (antiaggregates and/or heparin) has  greatly improved fetal prognosis. The risk of neonatal lupus (skin eruptions,  atrioventricular block) is essentially related to the presence of anti-Ro (SSA)  and anti-La (SSB) antibodies. It cannot be well predicted and prevention must be  conducted on an individual basis. Overall prognosis of pregnancy can be improved  by authorizing pregnancy when the lupus has reached in a well-controlled  quiescent phase for at least one year. A multidisciplinary surveillance  associating the medical and obstetric teams is required. Preexisting hypertension  and renal involvement are unfavorable factors; serum creatinine above 150 mumol/l  is considered a contraindication. When good clinical conditions can be achieved,  and possibly with low-dose corticosteroids (10 mg/d), the risk of a flare-up is  reduced and the rate of fetal survival is almost the same as in the non-lupus  female population. The rates of fetal adrenal insufficiency and infection are not  significantly higher. Infants are sometimes hypertrophic at birth and are usually  born prematurely. Acute pediatric care must be planned. Prognosis in case of "de  novo" lupus during pregnancy or pregnancy in a woman with uncontrolled or  poorly-controlled lupus remains poor and can be life-threatening for the mother.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) treatment, which is  immunomodulatory but not immunosuppressive, in SLE. MAIN ISSUES: IVIG indications  in SLE could be categorized as already validated as for chronic  polyradiculoneuropathy or thrombocytopenia; failure of classical treatment in  threatening active disease; undetermined manifestation as reactive hemophagocytic  syndrome which could be both disease-specific or iatrogenic, infection-related.  To date, no published study has firmly established the efficacy of IVIG in SLE.  CONCLUSION: IVIG therapy in SLE should be evaluated in prospective trials.

T1  - Pregnancy in lupus.
SP  - 348-51
AB  - Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with established disease have poorer  pregnancy outcomes than do women with later onset disease. Active renal disease  and maternal hypertension are important predictors of fetal loss and premature  birth, respectively. Placental pathology in SLE patients is characterized by  decidual vasculopathy and infarction, and in APLS patients, infarction can be  extensive. Maternal anti-52 kD SSA/Ro by immunoblot continues to be an important  risk factor for having a child with heart block. The risk of having a subsequent  child with congenital heart block ranges between 12-16%. Childhood morbidity with  heart block is high, with 63% eventually requiring pacemakers. In APLS,  antiB2GP-I antibodies can have a significant role in the diagnosis, especially  when the traditional assays for aCL antibodies and LAC are negative. Some  obstetricians have found that IVIG improves the birthrate in aPL positive women  who have recurrent spontaneous abortions after IVF.

T1  - [Pulmonary hypertension in rheumatic diseases].
SP  - 59-72
AB  - In rheumatic diseases (RD) pulmonary hypertension (PH) may result by either  direct damage of the pulmonary arteries (isolated PH) or pulmonary interstitial  fibrosis and other causes. PH is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in  systemic sclerosis in which it is more frequently isolated in the limited  cutaneous variant and secondary to interstitial fibrosis in the diffuse type. In  isolated PH the main histopathological finding is an occlusive arteriopathy. The  role of recurrent vasospasm ("lung Raynaud's phenomenon") is still being debated.  In systemic lupus erythematosus, although uncommon, PH is being increasingly  reported and may recognize multiple etiological factors including  vasoconstriction, vasculitis, in-situ pulmonary thrombosis or chronic recurrent  thromboembolism. PH may be a severe and often fatal complication of mixed  connective tissue disease and dermato/polymyositis. PH may also be diagnosed in  patients with rheumatoid arthritis, primary Sjogren's syndrome and primary  antiphospholipid syndrome. Doppler echocardiography is the technique of choice  for the evaluation of PH because it is nonivasive and allows serial  determinations of the arterial pulmonary pressure. The therapy of PH associated  with RD includes corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, calcium-antagonists,  ACE-inhibitors, anticoagulants, O2, prostacyclin or its stable analogue,  iloprost. Carefully selected patients may benefit from single lung or heart-lung  transplantation.

SP  - 126-31
AB  - Two patients with seropositive inflammatory arthropathies who experienced  clinical improvement on the Waianae diet are presented. The scientific literature  validates the usefulness of fasting in the control of joint inflammation.  Elimination diets are variably successful. Fasting followed by a vegetarian diet  can produce a sustained positive response measured clinically and by laboratory  variables of inflammation; the efficacy of such an approach appears to hinge on  the alteration of fecal flora. Swaying the balance of dietary fats in favor of  the omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids has an antiinflammatory effect, but does not  appear to correct the basic immunologic processes involved in the development of  the arthropathies. Practical guidelines for the application of this information  are offered.

SP  - 14-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the association between postmenopausal estrogen therapy and  chronic conditions not usually considered in risk-benefit reviews. DESIGN:  Ten-year literature review (1989-1998) of case series and epidemiologic studies  with risk estimates and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Osteoarthritis and  rheumatoid arthritis, the most extensively studied conditions, show no consistent  association with hormone therapy. Two studies of systemic lupus erythematosus  show a nearly three-fold increased risk apparent after 2 or more years of hormone  therapy. Single studies suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis, asthma, and  Raynaud's syndrome. Evidence for a reduced risk of diabetes mellitus is not  compelling. Cataracts and migraine are either increased or decreased by hormone  therapy. Among the associations considered here, only an increased risk of  gallbladder disease and venous thromboembolic disease have been confirmed in  clinical trials of hormone replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are  needed.

T1  - Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 49-61
AB  - The objective of this study was to look for the occurrence of catastrophic  antiphospholipid syndromes (APS) and to try to detect discriminating factors for  predicting a worse prognosis, related to Lupus anticoagulant (LA) and  antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with  main renal involvement. Regression, recursive partition and logistic regression  analyses were applied to our 80 SLE patients prospectively followed up since  1980. Immunologic and other laboratory parameters including beta 2-glycoprotein 1  dependence, resistance to activated protein C caused by a substitution on the  coagulation factor V gene, induction of monocyte procoagulant activity.  Regression studies demonstrated an overall worse prognosis in term of both  thrombosis and death for the group of LA/aPL positive patients (33/80). However,  recursive partition analysis was able to isolate a small high risk-subgroup  (8/33) characterized by persistent LA/aPL antibodies positive result, widespread  signs of noninflammatory vasculopathy (skin, brain, kidney) and renal pathology  mimicking that of thrombotic microangiopathy or arteriolosclerosis, also in the  absence of classic SLE-nephritis. Only in this subset, three catastrophic APS  were recorded, while, in traditional SLE nephritis, even persistent LA/aPL  positive results (sometimes after one previous thrombosis) did not seem to imply  a particularly severe prognosis. All serologic criteria employed are unable to  identify high-risk patients. We conclude that catastrophic APS is a rare event in  renal SLE. Before more predictive serologic markers become available, a simple  algorithm, dealing with clinical data and renal histologic patterns, may help  physicians to identify putatively high risk-LA/aPL antibodies in SLE patients  with main renal involvement. This ominous subset does not belong to the group of  classic SLE-nephritis.

T1  - Renal transplantation for end-stage renal disease caused by systemic lupus 
SP  - 77-85
AB  - The 1975 observations of the Advisory Committee of the Renal Transplant Registry  about systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remain largely unaltered. The SLE  patient's survival after renal transplantation has improved, but remains similar  to the non-SLE transplantation population. Disease activity declines throughout  the transplantation period with a low rate of graft loss due to recurrent  disease. There is slight discordant evidence about spontaneous renal recovery and  graft survival rates in the SLE transplant population. The latter difference may  relate to variances in the donor source (live-related versus cadaveric). The  original report did not address the now well-recognized immediate- and long-term  risks posed by the anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, the accelerated rate of  vascular disease, hematologic malignancies, and corticosteroid osteoporosis in  the SLE transplant recipient.

T1  - Lupus nephritis: novel immunosuppressive modalities and future directions.
SP  - 67-76
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystemic disease characterized by  alterations in the regulation of both cellular and humoral immune responses. B  cell hyperactivity and genetic aberrations lead to formation of compliment-fixing  IgG autoantibodies including anti-DNA and anti-nucleosome antibodies.  Pathological T cell clones that recognize double-stranded DNA and nucleosomes  further drive B cell production of DNA autoantibodies. Deposition of  autoantibodies within the skin, kidney, brain, and other organ systems  contributes to the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of SLE. A growing  body of experimental evidence indicates that DNA antibodies contribute to the  histological changes observed in lupus nephritis. The binding of anti-DNA and  other autoantibodies to basement membranes and other cellular structures within  the glomerulus results in activation of compliment and recruitment of  inflammatory cells into the glomerulus. The use of high-dose steroid hormones and  cytotoxic agents have improved patient and renal survival, but are associated  with major infection, infertility, osteoporosis, and secondary malignancies. New  pharmacological approaches to the treatment of lupus nephritis will include drugs  that deplete specific B cell clones involved in the synthesis of nephritogenic  autoantibodies as well as the blocking of signal transduction pathways required  for antigen-dependent antibody synthesis. Novel clonal-specific approaches to  immunosuppression in patients with SLE offer the potential for precise targeting  of the disease pathogenesis and for reducing toxic complications of treatment.

SP  - 2-11
AB  - Renal involvement occurs in the majority of patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus. Contemporary therapeutic regimens for immunosuppression and for  the treatment of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, infections, and seizures have  likely contributed to improvements in the prognosis of these patients over the  last four decades. Corticosteroids usually ameliorate the manifestations of lupus  nephritis but achieve less complete and sustained remissions than do cytotoxic  drugs. Among the cytotoxic drugs, pulse cyclophosphamide has one of the best  profiles of efficacy and toxicity. Because each episode of exacerbation of lupus  nephritis results in cumulative scarring, atrophy and fibrosis, we recommend  continued maintenance treatment for 1 year beyond the point of complete remission  of proliferative lupus nephritis. Studies are in progress to determine whether  innovative treatment strategies will enhance efficacy and minimize toxicity  associated with cytotoxic drug therapies. Lupus membranous nephropathy poses a  lower risk of renal failure, but persistent nephrotic syndrome confers risks of  cardiovascular events; this form of lupus nephritis is usually treated with less  intensive regimens of corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, or cyclosporine. The  prognosis and overall success of treatment for lupus nephritis seem to vary  widely among geographically and racially diverse populations. The causes for the  apparently worse prognosis and poorer responses to treatment of lupus nephritis  in Black patients are currently unexplained and require further study. Until such  data are available, caution is clearly warranted in extrapolating evidence,  particularly about prognosis and effects of treatment, among different  populations of patients with lupus nephritis.

T1  - Lupus nephritis in children.
SP  - 639-43
AB  - The renal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in childhood range from  minor abnormalities detected on urinalysis to severe renal insufficiency  requiring renal replacement therapy. Clinically significant renal involvement in  systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in children than in adults. Effective  treatment for childhood lupus nephritis is available, and the prognosis for  affected children has improved over the course of the last 30 years.  Corticosteroid therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for children with  lupus nephritis. The addition of cytotoxic agents to corticosteroid treatment  improves both the long and short-term prognoses. Cyclosporin may improve the  clinical manifestations of lupus nephritis although the disease remains active  serologically. Although survival in childhood lupus has improved, complications  of therapy result in significant morbidity with distressing frequency.  Immunosuppression may result in mortality and morbidity due to opportunistic  infections. Individuals with otherwise successful control of renal manifestations  of systemic lupus erythematosus may still be left with significant morbidity due  to disturbances in growth due to long-term corticosteroid treatment. Psychosocial  development may be adversely affected both as a result of chronic illness as well  as due to the effects of therapy. Meticulous attention to detail over decades of  treatment is necessary to optimize patient outcome in childhood lupus nephritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologic diagnoses and outcome of acute pericardial  effusion associated to acute renal renal failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A  retrospective study from 1978 to 1996 in a 10 bed medical/surgical intensive care  unit included 11 patients who have an acute pericardial effusion associated with  an acute renal failure. RESULTS: Etiological diagnoses were systemic lupus with  extracapillary glomerulonephritis (n = 2), systemic fibrosis with obstructive  renal failure (n = 2), anticoagulation accident with hemodynamic renal failure (n  = 2), lung adenocarcinoma (n = 2), adenocarcinoma of undetermined origin (n = 1),  systemic polyarteritis nodosa (n = 1), and Wegener granulomatosis (n = 1).  Intensive care unit deaths was 4, including 2 cases of neoplasic origin.  DISCUSSION: Despite infection or malignancy being claimed as the leading causes  of acute pericardial effusion, when associated to acute renal failure other  etiologic diagnoses, such connectivite tissue disease or vasculitis, must be  evoked that prompt specific treatment and could prevent unfavorable evolution.  Neoplasic causes were characterised by receiving pericardial effusion and a high  mortality rate.

T1  - Stem cell transplantation for severe autoimmune diseases: progress and problems.
SP  - 733-43
AB  - Since Morton and Siegel's epochal experiments 30 years ago animal models have  been successfully utilized both for transfer and resolution of autoimmune  diseases (AID). More recently human lymphocyte xenografts have reproduced  clinical AID in SCID mice. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation demonstrated  therapeutic potential in fully developed autoimmune disease. Mixed allogeneic  chimerism induced by a sublethal approach has also been shown to prevent and even  reverse autoimmune insulitis in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. More unexpectedly  it was found that experimental adjuvant arthritis (AA) and experimental allergic  encephalomyelitis (EAE) could be cured by means of total body irradiation (TBI)  followed by autologous hemolymphopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. It was  postulated that the newly developing T cells might be tolerant to self antigens.  The transfer of AID from affected donors to recipients of allogeneic HSC  transplants has been reported for many organ-specific AID, including diabetes  (IDDM), thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis and thrombocytopenic purpura (AITP);  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were not  transferred. Conversely patients with the combination of AID and a severe blood  disease (leukemia, aplasia) were cured of both diseases following allogeneic BMT,  with the notable exception of a relapse in a patient with RA despite full donor  engraftment. Allogeneic transplants are certainly more promising as far as  concerns a resolution of AID, because they may also exert a  graft-versus-autoimmunity effect by gradually eradicating the recipient's  lymphopoiesis, but transplant related mortality (TRM) is considered still too  high to employ this procedure consistently. New non-myeloablative conditioning  regimens, designed to allow the donor's immune system to take over, are already  utilized for malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases, and may become an  attractive option for severe, refractory AID. For the time being, however,  autologous procedures are still safer, and are being utilized in many projects  worldwide. The EBMT/EULAR Registry has collected over 70 patient reports. The  more numerous and favorable results have been obtained up to now in multiple  scleosis and in systemic lupus erythematosus; the worst in refractory autoimmune  thrombocytopenic purpura. No definite conclusions as to the efficacy of  autologous HSC transplantation, from marrow or from blood, with or without T-cell  depletion, may be drawn at this time, but the feeling is that real cures will be  very difficult to obtain by this approach, and that corticosteroid-free  remissions and a general lowering of the autoimmune potential will be more  realistic goals. Accurate comparisons with already existing aggressive  immunosuppressive protocols will become necessary, if possible by means of  prospective randomized clinical studies.

AB  - The patient, a 35-year-old woman, had been diagnosed as SLE since she developed  butterfly rash, arthritis and hair loss with positive antinuclear antibody,  anti-DNA antibody, and LE cells in 1989, and treated with daily 20 mg  prednisolone (PSL). She had been suffering from nausea, vomiting and waterly  diarrhea since 1992. In June 1995, she noted pollakisuria and sense of residual  urine, followed by dysuria and nocturia in October. She was admitted to our  hospital in January 1996 with progressive gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms.  Computerized tomography (CT) depicted thickening of the wall of intestine and  bladder, diminished volume of bladder, and bilateral hydronephrosis and  hydroureter. Biopsy of the bladder revealed erosion of mucosa and moderate  infiltration with inflammatory cells. The diagnosis of lupus cystitis and  peritonitis was made and she was initially given intravenous methylprednisolon  pulse therapy (500 mg/day) for 3 days, and then switched to 100 mg of daily  intravenous PSL. She responded partially to this regimen, but gradually developed  gastrointestinal and urinary symptoms again when PSL was tapered down to 70  mg/day. Therefore, monthly intravenous cyclophosuphamide pulse therapy was  started. With this therapy, her bladder and bowel symptoms improved, and then the  thickness of her bladder and intestinal wall, and the bladder volume normalized.  Five months after institution of therapy, PSL was successfully tapered down to 30  mg/day and she was discharged. Intravenous cyclophosphamidepulse therapy is a  choice of treatment for steroid-resistant lupus cystitis and peritonitis.

The risk of fetal loss is, however,  2-3 times higher than in the normal population and pre-eclampsia, prematurity and  fetal growth retardation frequently complicate these pregnancies. Pregnancies in  women with lupus nephritis are high-risk pregnancies and they require intense  fetal and maternal surveillance.

T1  - Perinatal outcomes in women with systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 178-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnancies of women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were  studied to assess the effects interaction of this disease and pregnancy. STUDY  DESIGN: Charts of pregnant women with a discharge diagnosis of lupus were  reviewed. Inclusion criterion was SLE diagnosed by the criteria of the American  College of Rheumatology. All patients were cared for at the University of North  Carolina Hospitals, a tertiary level university center. RESULTS: Between January  1988 and June 1995, we participated in the care of 21 women with the diagnosis of  SLE. Their obstetric histories included a total of 56 pregnancies spanning 19  years. Obstetric histories were divided into pregnancies occurring before the  patient was diagnosed with lupus and those pregnancies occurring after she had  been given the diagnosis. The diagnosis of lupus was made during the course of  five pregnancies; those five were categorized as occurring after diagnosis. Of  the pregnancies that occurred before a woman's diagnosis of SLE, 46% resulted in  live births, 36% ended in spontaneous abortion, and 18% ended in an intrauterine  fetal demise. Among pregnancies occurring after the diagnosis of SLE, 85%  resulted in live birth, 10% in spontaneous abortion, 3.3% in intrauterine fetal  demise, and 3.3% in neonatal death. Of all live births, 53% were delivered before  37 weeks' gestation. The most common causes of maternal morbidity were joint  involvement (n = 8) and dermatologic disorders (n = 6). Other clinical  manifestations of SLE included nephritis (n = 5), hypertension (n = 4), pleuritis  (n = 3), and thrombocytopenia (n = 3). One maternal death occurred as a result of  pulmonary disease. Four pregnancies were complicated by preeclampsia. Seven  patients were hospitalized during their pregnancies for lupus-related  complications. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial fetal, neonatal, and maternal risks still  exist for pregnant women with lupus.

T1  - The pathophysiology of lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 4-7
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus disseminatus in addition to the more restricted,  lupus-like syndromes, is the consequence of an attack by the immune system on the  cellular and nuclear structures of the body. These disorders are also frequently  associated with disturbances of the coagulation cascade. In this review paper,  the factors that provoke or enhance these disturbances are considered, as well as  the way by which this provocative effect is exerted. An intermutual relation  between various elements is described, whereby congenital factors (heredity,  race) and non-congenital factors (sex hormones, pregnancy, environment,  ultraviolet light, drugs, infection) play a role. These factors induce the  activation cascade of the disease, via two different axes: on the one hand  modifications in the DNA structure, on the other immune stimulation. This  eventually results in tissue damage.

SP  - 35-41
AB  - The major initial clinical manifestations of systemic lupus erythematousus (SLE)  were skin and mucous membrane involvement (52%), fever and malaise (48%),  arthritis and arthralgias (44%). Lupus nephritis was diagnosed in 74% of patients  and diffuse proliferative nephritis was the commonest histologic picture  encountered. Except for a higher prevalence of anti-SS-A (Ro) (63%), other  autoantibodies were within the normal range reported from Western countries.  There was no significant association between HLA-A, B or DR specificities in 51  Chinese patients, nor was there any differences seen in the polymorphism of  tumour necrosis factor alpha gene (TNF-alpha). Arthritis was less commonly seen  in males with SLE. Prevalences of leukopenia and antibodies to anti-SS-A (Ro) and  anti-La (SS-B) antigens were lower in men. Late onset lupus patients (> 50 years  of age) tended to have more insidious onset of disease, lower female predominance  and less frequent complaints of fever, alopecia, arthritis and malar rash at  presentation. The causes of death were often treatment related. Survival studies  among 183 SLE patients during the period from 1970 to 1980 revealed a 5- and  10-year survival rate of 70% and 60%, respectively. Infections and active lupus  disease were 2 major causes of death. Research into SLE is targeted at increasing  our understanding of the disease process and improving outcome and prognosis.

SP  - 355-60
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may improve, exacerbate or be unchanged during  pregnancy. The activity of SLE at the time of conception has a major influence on  pregnancy outcome: SLE patients with quiescent disease do well, while those with  active, uncontrollable disease have a high abortion rate. There are specific  autoantibodies that confer a high risk of abortion (e.g., IgG antiphospholipid  antibodies). There are others, such as anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB, which confer  a risk for neonatal lupus that includes lupus dermatitis, congenital complete  heart block, thrombocytopenia and cholestatic jaundice, in order of their  relative frequencies.

SP  - 415-8
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the fetal and neonatal outcomes of  pregnancies conceived during the inactive phase of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE). Fetal and neonatal outcomes in 75 pregnancies of 33 patients with SLE were  analyzed. In 19 patients (57.6%) the SLE also had hematological autoimmune  presentations prior to gestation, such as anemia, thrombopenia, garnulocytopenia,  and antiphospholipid antibody and/or lupus anticoagulant (APA). Out of 75  pregnancies, 19 elective terminations were carried out because the disease was  active or for non-medical reasons. The adverse fetal outcomes of those 56  pregnancies which occurred during the inactive phase were compared with those of  the control patients. In SLE, the rates of spontaneous abortions (46.4%) and  newborns with low (< 2500 gr) birthweight (36.7%) were found to increase roughly  three times that of the controls and the perinatal fetal loss (16.7%) also  increased significantly as compared with the control group (28.5 per thousand).  APA noted at any time before pregnancy increased the low birthweight rate (75%)  six fold and the perinatal loss (33.3%) more than ten fold but did not affect the  rate of spontaneous abortions. Any kind of hemocytopenias without APA, noted  before pregnancy did not worsen the fetal outcome in SLE. Neonatal lupus was  diagnosed in 2 out of the 30 newborns. Our results suggest that among the  hematologic manifestations of SLE presenting before pregnancy, APA can predict  the high risks of low birthweight and perinatal fetal loss as opposed to  hemocytopenias.

SP  - 422-34
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an inflammatory systemic disease that  causes organ damage by the deposition of autoantibodies and complement activating  immune complexes or by vascular occlusion due to procoagulant states associated  with antiphospholipid antibodies. The vast majority of cases occur in women of  childbearing age. SLE is diagnosed on the basis of its clinical manifestations  and the demonstration of characteristic immunological phenomena, especially  anti-nuclear antibodies. The prognosis in SLE has shown a distinct improvement  over recent decades, the 5-year survival rate now approaching or exceeding 90%.  The 15-year survival rate of 63 to 79%, on the other hand, underscores the need  for further advances in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Management of the  disease includes regular monitoring of disease activity, avoidance of  predisposing factors and close supervision of therapy. Drug therapy is guided by  the activity and severity of the leading organ manifestations and ranges from  nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs to intensive treatment with cytotoxic agents.  Corticosteroids remain irreplaceable for the control of acute flares.  Antimalarials and azathioprine are important long term drugs for treating mild or  moderate disease activity. Intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide is safer than other  regimens and at least as effective as oral cyclophosphamide for severe lupus  nephritis. It is also effective in the treatment of central nervous disease and  of other organ-threatening manifestations. Recently, an intensified protocol  which included cyclophosphamide induced long term treatment-free remission in 60%  of patients. The toxicity of cyclophosphamide is considerable, but can be  ameliorated by various measures. The value of several new immunosuppressants and  other compounds remains to be determined.

T1  - Outcome of renal transplantation in systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 17-26
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To provide an overview of the world's experience with renal  transplantation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and to consider the most  important studies in detail. (2) To examine four specific questions raised by the  review, including (a) the frequency of recurrent lupus glomerulonephritis (GN);  (b) the effect of pretransplantation dialysis on transplantation outcome; (c) the  method of monitoring lupus activity in transplant patients; and (d) the frequency  of early graft loss among lupus patients. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE search  of the world's literature from 1975 to 1997 on the subject of renal  transplantation in SLE, using the search terms "lupus," "SLE," "kidney," "renal  transplantation," and "outcome." We included in this review 20 original reports  that devoted significant attention to the outcome of renal transplantation among  patients with lupus. RESULTS: Of the nine studies that compared the  transplantation outcomes of lupus patients with those of transplant patients with  other causes of end-stage renal disease, the allograft survival rates were  superior in the comparison groups in six, and approximately equivalent in three.  The 1-year allograft survival rate of lupus patients with cadaveric renal  transplants (CRTs) was 67% in the largest multicenter study, significantly lower  than the rate for the other 14 diseases examined (77%; P = .009). In most  studies, the lupus groups were significantly younger than their comparison  groups, but they frequently included larger percentages of black patients. Lupus  patients who received living-related renal transplants (LRRTs) generally had  superior graft survival rates compared with those who received CRTs. In the  largest single-center report, the 5-year graft survival rate in the cyclosporine  era was 89% for LRRTs, compared with 41% for CRTs. Recurrence of lupus nephritis  in the allograft is relatively rare, approximately 2%; this estimate is probably  low. However, recurrent lupus glomerular nephritis (GN) did not invariably result  in allograft failure. Short length of pretransplantation dialysis (i.e., less  than 6 months) had no adverse effect on transplantation outcome in 10 of 11  studies that examined the relationship. Pretransplantation serological  parameters, such as complement and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels,  appear to be unreliable predictors of the likelihood of recurrence, and also may  be inaccurate measures of disease activity in the posttransplantation period.  Finally, 9 of the 20 studies reviewed noted an increased risk of early graft loss  among lupus transplant patients, possibly because of an increased frequency of  acute injection reactions and thrombotic events associated with antiphospholipid  antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that many lupus patients have excellent  renal transplantation outcomes, substantial evidence indicates that renal  transplant patients with lupus do not fare as well as patients with other causes  of end-stage renal disease. Lupus patients may be particularly susceptible to  adverse events occurring in the first year after transplantation. Further  investigation is needed to improve renal transplantation outcomes for patients  with lupus.

T1  - [Cyclophosphamide therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus].
SP  - 178-89
AB  - Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat  renal and central nervous system manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus  (SLE). It is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis.  Within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the  standard therapy in severe SLE due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and  fewer side effects as compared to oral application. Studies on the slightly more  cost-effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published,  however, there are no data on long-term results yet. Here, we review the effects  and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on  cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in SLE. Because of the possible side effects,  especially the high risk of malignancies, which sharply increases at a cumulative  dose of approximately 60 g, cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously.  Cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special  experience.

SP  - 317-20
AB  - Persistent fetal bradycardia is rarely encountered during pregnancy. When it is  associated with a complete atrio-ventricular (A-V) block, it may prove dangerous  to the fetus or newborn. The prenatal diagnosis is vital because it necessitates  close follow-up during pregnancy to detect fetal compromise and proper  preparation for delivery. We describe a woman who was found to be suffering from  systemic lupus erythematosus during pregnancy. The fetus was diagnosed as having  persistent fetal bradycardia due to complete A-V block at 28 weeks of gestation  and was delivered at term with conservative management. The problems entailed in  managing pregnancy and delivery of such fetuses are discussed.

Over 70% of  individuals with autoimmune diseases are women, though some conditions (e.g.,  ankylosing spondylitis) are more common in men. Many authorities have focused on  sex hormones as an explanation for the relatively high proportion of females  affected by autoimmune diseases. This article covers systemic lupus  erythematosus, the prototypical autoimmune disease, and antiphospholipid  syndrome, which is associated particularly with pregnancy loss.

T1  - Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and systemic lupus erythematosus. Clinical 
SP  - 192-202
AB  - Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) complicating systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  remains a devastating pulmonary complication of this systemic disease. We  conducted this study to review the clinicopathologic presentation and the effects  of prior treatment, presence of infection, and current treatment on the survival  and outcome of patients with DAH and SLE. We reviewed the records of 15 SLE  patients who experienced 19 episodes of DAH over a 10-year period in a single  tertiary care hospital. These patients were compared with 57 previously reported  cases. The 19 episodes of DAH represented 3.7% of the 510 admissions occasioned  by various complications of SLE. As previously reported, the majority (66%) were  women with a median age of 27 years. The onset was often abrupt: < 3 days in 12  of the episodes. In 3 patients (20%), DAH was the initial manifestation of SLE,  compared with 11% in the literature series. In the other patients in the present  series, DAH appeared a median of 31 months following the diagnosis of SLE, versus  35 months in the literature series. In only 42% of the episodes in the present  series, compared with 66% in the literature series, was hemoptysis present at the  time of admission. However, hemoptysis eventually appeared in all 19 episodes.  Temperature elevation (> 38 degrees C) was another inconsistent finding, found in  only 5 episodes (26%) in the present series. The most constant concurrent  systemic finding was lupus nephritis (14/15 patients). This represents a  significant increase when compared with the literature series (29/48 patients).  In 8 of 10 patients in whom lung tissue was available, pulmonary capillaritis  accompanied the DAH. This represents a marked difference in the underlying  histologic pattern when compared with the literature series. In those patients,  72% (31/43 patients) had bland pulmonary hemorrhage, and capillaritis was  described in only 6 patients. The overall patient mortality rate was 53% in the  current series and 50% in the literature series. Factors associated with an  increased mortality in the present series include the following: mechanical  ventilation (62%) versus no mechanical ventilation (0%); infection (78%) versus  no infection (20%); and cyclophosphamide therapy for the acute DAH episode (70%)  versus no cyclophosphamide therapy (20%). The incidence of infection in DAH and  SLE (9/19 episodes) is far greater than previously reported (7/ 57 episodes). One  possible explanation for this difference is the increased use of outpatient  immunosuppressive therapy with monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy for  lupus nephritis. Eighteen DAH episodes in the present series were treated with  intravenous methylprednisolone. When one combines both the current and literature  series experience (16 episodes), the use of plasmapheresis does not improve  survival. Of the 7 patients in the present series who survived all episodes of  DAH, 6 remain alive a median of 50 months post episode and without recurrence of  DAH. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is an uncommon but lethal complication of SLE.  The survival rate remains unchanged from previous reports. The absence of  hemoptysis should not exclude this diagnosis, particularly in those patients who  experience an acute pulmonary syndrome with new radiographic infiltrates  accompanied by falling hematocrit and the presence of a hemorrhagic  bronchoalveolar lavage. Evidence for lupus nephritis is present in the great  majority of cases. Most cases demonstrate the histologic pattern of pulmonary  capillaritis. The mortality is adversely affected by the need for mechanical  ventilation, either the presence of infection at the time of admission or the  development of infection in the hospital, and the use of cyclophosphamide for  treatment of the acute event.

T1  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in rheumatic diseases other than systemic 
SP  - 94-7
AB  - Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are increasingly available as an alternative to  whole marrow aspirate for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). They may be derived  from an HLA matched individual (allogeneic) or from the patient (autologous).  Allogeneic BMT is associated with a 15 to 35% mortality, largely due to graft  versus host disease. Autologous HSC are used to rescue the patient after severe  immunosuppression, and the transplant related mortality is 3 to 5%. The  opportunity to ablate severe autoimmune disease with increased safety is  particularly attractive for necrotizing vasculitides,  polymyositis/dermatomyositis, primary Sjogren's syndrome, systemic juvenile  arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, and Behcet's disease, where correct  selection of cases would ensure an acceptable benefit/risk ratio. Rheumatoid  arthritis (RA), psoriasis associated arthritis (PsA) and some non-rheumatic  diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, and type 1  diabetes mellitus may also be candidates, but careful selection of patients with  a poor prognosis is necessary. There are allogeneic BMT data from patients with  aplastic anemia or leukemia and concurrent RA, PsA, and IBD and also autologous  HSC BMT data from animal models to support the concept of cure. Patient studies  should proceed using recently published protocol guidelines and centralized data  collection.

AB  - Transfer of disease by bone marrow cells has been described in experimental  models of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In one experiment, marrow ablation  followed by transfer of T depleted allogeneic marrow resulted in prolonged  survival of animals with SLE. Some experimental studies suggest a rationale for  autologous stem cell transplantation indicating this intervention might "reset  the thermostat" so that normal immunoregulation can control disease, while others  indicate it might not be beneficial. The pros and cons of offering patients with  SLE autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are considered. A profile  of the patient with SLE who might be considered as a candidate for autologous  stem cell transplantation can be constructed by evaluating causes of death and  factors that increase mortality. This profile includes life threatening disease,  inadequate response to aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, and adequate  function of all major organs so that risks associated with stem cell  transplantation can be minimized.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disorder with an  annual incidence of 50 to 70/million and a prevalence of 500/million population.  The highest incidence is observed in women aged 20 to 40 years. The clinical  manifestations of SLE are remarkably heterogeneous. Major organ system  involvement may occur in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and central nervous system  and is responsible for most of the mortality and morbidity caused by the disease.  Complications of drug treatment, in particular corticosteroid side effects,  contribute to longterm morbidity. The major causes of death are directly related  to the disease and include acute vascular neurologic events, renal failure,  cardiovascular or pulmonary involvement, infection, and coronary artery disease.

AB  - Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and  rheumatoid arthritis cause significant morbidity and mortality. Although  aggressive treatments may suppress disease activity in some cases, there are few  if any complete cures. Since these conditions arise as a direct result of  dysregulation of the immune system, modification of immune stem cells may be  important in their control. Some slow acting antirheumatic drugs have significant  effect on bone marrow, and more recently a number of case reports have appeared  in which autoimmune diseases have gone into remission after bone marrow  transplantation for other reasons. Data from animal models of autoimmune disease  show significant abrogation of inflammation following bone marrow  transplantation. Advances in the technology of stem cell transplantation coupled  with increasing ability to identify at an early stage those patients likely to  develop severe autoimmune disease require an indepth study of the role of stem  cell transplantation for these conditions.

AB  - Animal models of autoimmune disease have been successfully used to explore  peripheral stem cell transfusion and bone marrow transplantation. Allogeneic  marrow transplants have been shown to suppress lupus-like disease and  experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Autologous transplantation has also been  successful in adjuvant arthritis. Operationally, these may be considered as graft  versus autoimmunity effects. In humans, adoptive autoimmunity, in which the donor  becomes apparent in the recipient, has been documented for myasthenia gravis and  insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Of 9 allogeneic bone marrow transplants for  rheumatoid arthritis, 4 patients have done well for many years while one relapsed  after 2 years. In 2 cases, autologous marrow transplant has been used  specifically to treat autoimmune disease: one patient with CREST had only a  transient response and one patient with myasthenia gravis had remission. While  allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the most rational procedure, its use in  nonmalignant disorders must be very carefully considered secondary to its  toxicity and potential morbidity. The use of peripheral blood CD34+ cells with T  cell depletion, may promise complete or partial longterm remission but results of  this therapy need to be compared with other immunosuppressive combinations.

AB  - With over 4 decades of seminal contributions to the development and application  of BMT, Dr. Thomas stresses the importance of collaboration between  rheumatologists and transplant clinicians in developing this evolving area of  treatment. While the debate concerning the value of TBI in the conditioning  regimen and the use of autologous or allogeneic stem cells will continue, he  states there is simply no other way to answer these questions than to begin well  designed clinical studies. As pointed out by Dr. Hahn, unexpected post-transplant  complications may arise in patients with SSc and SLE and possibly require  modifications to the transplant procedure similar to the experience in patients  with other specific diseases. Other difficulties may be encountered, including  restricted funding of the transplant procedure by insurance carriers. The  emergence of managed care contracts and payer limitations in the United States  described by Dr. Appelbaum could hinder the development of innovative, curative  therapies. As initial clinical data are being collected, it is vital to actively  support patient referral and participation in clinical studies that will  ultimately establish the indications, risks, costs, and benefits of hematopoietic  stem cell transplantation for autoimmune disease.

AB  - With improvements in diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis of patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus has generally improved in recent years, and  similarly the outlook for women who become pregnant in the setting of this  disorder is far more optimistic than it once was. The risk of significant  morbidity to both the mother and fetus exists, however. Beginning with  preconception counseling, a careful and thorough approach to the care of the  patient and cooperation among her various health care providers optimizes the  chance of a successful pregnancy.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus flares during pregnancy.
SP  - 15-30
AB  - Lupus activity during pregnancy has been the subject of much research and debate  recently. Data point to increased SLE activity during pregnancy. SLE may flare  during any trimester of pregnancy, as well as in the puerperium; however, flares  are usually mild, affecting skin and joints, and, unless affecting the kidney, do  not confer any adverse prognosis on pregnancy outcome. Diagnosis of SLE flares  can be difficult during pregnancy and must rely on a thorough clinical and  laboratory assessment. Recent data link sex hormones, particularly prolactin, to  SLE activity, which may be one explanation for the high frequency of SLE flares  during pregnancy. No data support the thesis that corticosteroids prevent SLE  flares during pregnancy, and therefore, prophylactic prednisone should not be  given routinely. HCQ does seem to be safe for the fetus, however. SLE flares can  be treated, depending on severity, with NSAIDs or with HCQ, prednisone, or  azathioprine.

T1  - The Italian Registry of Antiphospholipid Antibodies.
SP  - 101-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The clinical importance of antiphospholipid antibodies  (APA) derives from their association with a syndrome of venous and arterial  thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss and thrombocytopenia known as the  antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The Italian Registry of Antiphospholipid  Antibodies was set up in 1989 for the purpose of collecting a large number of  patients with lupus anticoagulant (LA) or anticardiolipin antibodies (ACA) for  clinical studies in order to obtain more information on the clinical features of  APS. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The Italian Registry has completed two  clinical studies and proposed an international trial on the treatment of APS  patients. These activities of the Registry are reviewed herein. Additional  information has been obtained from pertinent articles and abstracts published in  journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF ART: The  first study of the Registry was a retrospective analysis of enrolled patients  which showed that: a) the prevalence of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia was  similar in cases with idiopathic APA or APA secondary to systemic lupus  erythematosus, and b) the rate of thrombosis was significantly reduced in  patients with severe thrombocytopenia but not in those with only a mild reduction  of the platelet count. The second study was a prospective survey of the natural  history of the disease, showing that a) previous thrombosis and ACA titer > 40  units were independent predictors of subsequent vascular complications; b) a  history of miscarriage or thrombosis is significantly associated with adverse  pregnancy outcome; c) hematological malignancies can develop during follow-up and  patients with APA should be considered at increased risk of developing NHL. Thus  the possibility of a hematologic neoplastic disease should be borne in mind in  the initial evaluation and during the follow-up of these patients. PERSPECTIVES:  The latest initiative of the Registry was the proposal of an international,  randomized clinical trial (WAPS study) aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety  of high-dose warfarin in preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with APA and  vascular disease. The study is scheduled to start in March 1997.

T1  - Side-effects of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy.
SP  - 254-7
AB  - We reviewed the side-effects of intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide (CPM) pulse  therapy in a group of 75 patients suffering from various autoimmune disorders  (mostly systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis) who received a total of 451  i.v. CPM pulses, given on a monthly basis (mean +/- s.d. CPM dose per pulse: 764  +/- 217 mg; mean +/- s.d. follow-up period: 26.7 +/- 22.1 mon). Infection was the  most common side-effect (30 episodes in 21 patients; 28% of the patients) but  rarely required in-patient treatment (8 episodes in 7 patients; 9% of the  patients). No relationship could be found between the occurrence of infection and  the dose of CPM or of glucocorticoids. Other side-effects were rare. Only one  patient suffered from neutropenia. Haemorrhagic cystitis was never observed nor  did premature ovarian failure in the 25 female patients at risk. Four patients  developed neoplasia and three died suddenly a few days after receiving a CPM  pulse but the causal relationship between CPM therapy and these poor outcomes is  speculative. Taken together, our data confirm in a large group of patients that  i.v. CPM pulse therapy is relatively safe. In particular, the rate of severe  infection requiring in-patient treatment is rare (1.8% of 451 pulses.).

SP  - 235-42
AB  - We studied the frequency, location, clinical and histopathological features,  associated manifestations, and prognosis of vasculitides in a cohort of 667 SLE  patients. Exclusion of patients with previous vasculitis or insufficient  information left 540 patients, 194 of whom has vasculitis (incidence density:  0.053 new cases/person/year, cumulative incidence of 0.051 at one year, 0.232 at  5 years and 0.411 at 10 years). Vasculitis was confirmed by biopsy in 46 cases,  by arteriography in five, and by both in three. A single episode of vasculitis  occurred in 119 and two or more in 75 patients. Vasculitis was cutaneous in 160,  visceral in 24, both in 10. In the first episode of cutaneous vasculitides, 111  had punctuate lesions, 32 palpable purpura, 6 urticaria, 6 ulcers, 8 papules, 5  erythematous plaques or macules confirmed with biopsy, 2 erythema with necrosis,  and 1 panniculitis (plus small vessel vasculitis). Of 29 with visceral vasculitis  in the first episode, 19 had mononeuritis multiplex, 5 digital necrosis, 3 large  artery vasculitis of limbs, one mesenteric, and one coronary, more than one type  could appear simultaneously or in subsequent episodes. Patients with vasculitis  had longer disease duration and followup, younger age of onset of SLE, and were  more frequently males than those without. Lupus manifestations associated with  vasculitis in univariate logistic regression included myocarditis, psychosis,  Raynaud's phenomenon, serositis, leukopenia, lymphopenia and pleuritis.  Vasculitis also associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome. The strength of  this association increased when patients with vasculitis confirmed by biopsy  and/or arteriography were considered separately. Visceral vasculitis associated  with increased mortality when controlled for age of onset and nephropathy.

T1  - Treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 527-35
AB  - Lupus nephritis is a prototype of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. A  broad range of clinical presentations and histological changes (proliferative,  membranous, or both) are observed. Patients are at risk for progressive renal  function deterioration as a result of the interaction of various active  immunologic and chronic sclerosing mechanisms of kidney injury. Hypertension and  hyperlipidemia contribute to morbidity and mortality. Monitoring serological  parameters, urinary protein excretion rate and, especially, the urinary sediment  facilitate the prompt recognition and treatment of this disorder. Kidney biopsy  evaluation often clarifies the type, severity, and potential reversibility of the  underlying renal lesions. Although contemporary immunosuppressive regimens for  proliferative lupus nephritis have reduced the risk of end-stage renal failure,  they are potentially toxic and not universally effective. Decisions regarding the  intensity and duration of these treatments are difficult and are based on the  severity of the disease, the initial response to therapy, and the risk for  drug-induced toxicities. Studies are in progress to evaluate alternative regimens  for proliferative lupus nephritis and membranous lupus nephropathy.

T1  - The role of the kidney biopsy in the treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 765-73
AB  - The renal biopsy plays an important role in the clinical evaluation of patients  with lupus erythematosus. From numerous studies of renal biopsies in lupus  nephritis, it has become clear that although the renal lesions are quite varied,  the pattern of renal involvement correlates with the clinical outcome. The broad  spectrum of lesions seen in lupus nephritis has been attributed to individual  differences in the immune response in different patients or in the same patient  during the course of disease. Classification of lupus nephritis authorized by the  World Health Organization has provided a standardized approach to the findings on  renal biopsy. This classification combines all of the morphologic modalities of  biopsy interpretation including light, immuno-fluorescence, and electron  microscopy as well as providing a semiquantitative assessment of activity and  chronicity. The clinical correlations utilizing this histologic classifications  have demonstrated that the specific nature of the renal histopathology can  predict both the acute and long-term outcome of the renal disease in patients  with lupus erythematosus and can be useful in determining the management of  individual patients.

SP  - 468-76
AB  - To analyze the long-term outcome in patients with silent lupus nephritis, we  retrospectively studied 20 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus without  clinical renal involvement who had renal biopsies in our unit between 1978 and  1986 and reviewed 193 cases reported between 1957 and 1995. Two patients of the  current series were lost to follow-up. Mean follow-up in the other 18 was 13 +/-  3 years (range, 2 to 17). On kidney biopsy, nine had class I, six class II, one  class IV, and two class V disease (WHO classification). Three patients with prior  normal renal function died of nonrenal causes. During the study, the remaining 15  patients had normal renal function and urinalysis. Most patients from the  literature had "mild" histologic lesions, but 30 had diffuse proliferative  glomerulonephritis. Over an average of 46 months of follow-up from biopsy, renal  survival rate and patient survival rate were 98% and 91%, respectively. Three  patients died of end-stage renal failure. In conclusion, end-stage renal failure  in patients with silent lupus nephritis is rare regardless of the  histopathological renal lesions. Patients survival depends on nonrenal causes.

T1  - Transverse myelopathy in SLE: clinical features and functional outcomes.
SP  - 294-9
AB  - The objective of the study was to examine the clinical features of lupus patients  who present with transverse myelopathy (TM) and ascertain functional outcomes  when treated early with high dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide. Case  records of nine patients who developed a total of 14 episodes of TM were  retrospectively studied. All the patients were female and their ages ranged from  21 to 59 years. Nine episodes of paraparesis, three of tetraparesis, one of  numbness and one of neurogenic bladder were reported early in the diagnosis of  SLE (median of two years). Neurogenic bowel and bladder and presence of ANA and  ds-DNA were invariable. Urodynamics assessment in six patients showed abnormal  detrusor behavior in all. CT scans and myelograms were uninformative and CSF  studies were normal. ESR and complement levels were insensitive as markers of  disease activity. The treatment regimens included pulses of methylprednisolone  and/or cyclophosphamide followed by prednisolone and high dose prednisolone from  onset. The functional outcomes were uniformly good-with independent ambulation in  all except three (who needed assistive devices) and improvement of motor scores.  Acute hospital stays were short (range of three to 45 days) whilst only two were  referred for inpatient rehabilitation. Bladder abnormalities persisted despite  motor recovery and would require long-term review.

T1  - End-stage renal disease and systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 100-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the course of systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE) following the onset of end-stage lupus nephropathy, regarding clinical and  serological manifestations, survival on dialysis, and renal transplant outcomes.  METHODS: A review of the pertinent literature, identified by a comprehensive  Grateful Med search, was performed. RESULTS: There is a tendency for decreased  clinical and serological lupus activity following the onset of end-stage renal  disease. The pathophysiology of this quiescence remains unclear. Survival of  lupus patients on dialysis is no different from that of non-SLE dialysis  patients, and is better than that of several other rheumatic diseases. Following  renal transplantation, there is no difference in patient or graft survival in  lupus versus nonlupus patients. Like their nonlupus counterparts, SLE transplant  patients do better with living relative grafts and/or regimens containing  cyclosporin A. Transplantation is not recommended within 3 months of the  initiation of dialysis to allow possible recovery from the acute renal failure.  Transplantation during an acute exacerbation of SLE is controversial, and may  increase the risk of poor outcomes. Recurrence of lupus in transplanted  allografts, often with the same histopathology as in the native kidney, occurs at  a rate (2.7% to 3.8%) comparable to that for all allograft transplant failures  (2% to 4%). CONCLUSIONS: End-stage lupus nephropathy patients require less  medication owing to decreased disease activity. They are good candidates for  dialysis and renal transplantation, with survival and recurrence rates no  different from those of other patients with end-stage renal disease.

T1  - Antimalarial drugs in pregnancy--the North American experience.
SP  - S67-9
AB  - The use of the 4-aminoquinoline antimalarials in pregnancy is controversial. The  current practice of discontinuing these medications because of pregnancy makes  little sense as the half-life of these medications is so long. Patients with SLE  have increased fetal wastage and one of the factors known to contribute to this  fetal wastage is disease activity. It is also known that discontinuing the  4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs can precipitate flares of disease in lupus  patients. Mothers and their potential offspring are therefore at risk for flares  of disease and pregnancy failure if these medications are discontinued because of  pregnancy. This review addresses the North American experience of the use of  antimalarial drugs in pregnant lupus patients. Unlike most centers in North  America, we continue our patients on these medications throughout pregnancy and  to date have documented 16 lupus patients who have taken these drugs throughout  pregnancy. Our most recent study documents nine pregnancies in eight women. All  of these pregnancies resulted in live births (five pre-term deliveries and four  full-term deliveries). There were no congenital abnormalities in these infants  and follow-up to date has revealed no evidence of ocular or oral deficits in any  of these children. One patient experienced a flare of disease when her  antimalarial therapy was temporarily discontinued.

T1  - Managing lupus nephritis: algorithms for conservative use of renal biopsy.
SP  - 106-15
AB  - SUMMARY: Despite the widespread use of renal biopsy to guide the treatment of  lupus nephritis, the disease can usually be diagnosed and managed on the basis of  its clinical presentation alone. We propose a conservative approach in which  biopsy is used selectively and present three algorithms that allow for a  simplified initial approach to managing lupus nephritis. KEY POINTS: Although the  grading systems of the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of  Health for renal biopsy results are commonly used to guide the treatment of lupus  nephritis, there are limits to the utility of these systems. Physicians can  distinguish clinically mild lupus nephritis, the nephrotic syndrome, or the  nephritic syndrome on the basis of the urine sediment, urine protein excretion,  serum albumin and creatinine concentrations, and creatinine clearance, and can  initiate treatment on the basis of this information, rather than performing a  renal biopsy. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy for lupus nephritis,  but new therapies are emerging. The nephritic syndrome reflects active disease  and requires more vigorous treatment. It may be prudent to reserve renal biopsy  for situations that arise later in the course of lupus nephritis, such as failure  to respond to therapy based on the initial clinical presentation.

SP  - 129-33
AB  - Life-threatening exacerbations of systemic lupus erythematosus can endanger the  function of vital organ systems and require massive immunosuppressive treatment  after the diagnostic delineation of the situation. In addition to high dosages of  corticosteroids, the introduction of high dose intravenous cyclophosphamide has  improved the prognosis of organ function in SLE in the past years. The concept of  plasmapheresis has been left in most centers, although in vitally dangerous  situations the application of selective immunoglobulin removal techniques  (immunoabsorption) has been reported to be beneficial. The long-term treatment  following the acute exacerbations has to consider the side effects of all  immunosuppressive drugs like infections and neoplasia, although the danger of  another autoaggressive attack of the patient's own immune system has to be kept  in mind.

T1  - The coexistence of psoriasis with lupus erythematosus and other photosensitive 
SP  - 1-15
AB  - The coexistence of psoriasis with LE or other photosensitive disorders is rare in  our patient population, occurring in 0.69% of patients with psoriasis and 1.1% of  those with LE. PMLE was the most common cause of photosensitivity in psoriatic  patients without LE, occurring in 32%. Less common causes included drug-related  photosensitivity (thiazides and thiazide derivatives in four of the five cases),  PUVA reactions, and photocontact reactions. The Goeckerman regimen or UVB applied  in a cautious, well-controlled atmosphere was generally well tolerated in this  group, including patients with PMLE. Photosensitivity occurred in 50% of our  patients with psoriasis and LE, and it was secondary to LE in 70% of cases. Most  patients were female and had SLE. Psoriasis developed first in 55% of the cases.  Studies that were useful for distinguishing photosensitive from nonphotosensitive  patients with SLE included determination of antibodies to extractable nuclear  antigens (67% versus 14%), double-stranded DNA (64% versus 9%), and skin biopsy  for direct immunofluorescence (58% versus 27%). Occasional patients have features  suggestive of photosensitivity with or without signs or symptoms of LE. These  patients may have atypical psoriatic plaques occasionally yielding routine  histology diagnostic of psoriasis with direct immuno-fluorescence results  suggestive of lupus. Frequently, connective tissue serology findings are  positive, and affected patients require close follow-up for the development of  LE. In patients with psoriasis and suspected photosensitivity, we recommend a  careful history and examination, skin biopsy for routine histology and direct  immunofluorescence, blood tests including determination of antibodies to  antinuclear antibodies (Hep-2 substrate if negative on routine substrate),  extractable nuclear antigens, and double-stranded DNA, and phototesting when  indicated. Large-scale prospective studies are required before the most  appropriate therapy for patients with psoriasis and LE can be recommended.

SP  - 184-92
AB  - A prospective study was performed to investigate the fetal and maternal outcome  of 108 pregnancies in 90 lupus patients. The protocol was based on shared care of  the patients by a rheumatologist and an obstetrician, with input from a  hematologist, if necessary. Lupus flares were treated with low-dose prednisolone,  azathioprine and hydroxychloroquine. The live birth rate was increased from 31 %  in the patients' previous obstetric history to 82%. A high incidence of  prematurity was observed (43%). Lupus patients with secondary antiphospholipid  syndrome presented a higher risk for fetal loss (P = .006). Flares occurred in  57% of the pregnancies, but most were mild (skin and joints). Flare during  pregnancy did not increase the risk of fetal loss. We believe that careful  monitoring and management of the lupus pregnancy has substantially improved the  fetal outcome.

T1  - Prognosis and treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 402-8
AB  - This article summarizes the evidence for improved prognosis in patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including reasons for improved survival, as  well as the risk for mortality, which remains high for patients with this  disease. Causes of death are reviewed, and prognostic factors are examined. Other  outcome measures for prognosis in SLE, including specific organ damage,  accumulated damage index, health status, and quality of life are considered. The  continuing controversy regarding the use of cyclophosphamide is reviewed,  together with new therapeutic approaches.

T1  - Clinicopathological study of dialysis patients with lupus nephritis.
SP  - 456-61
AB  - To determine the clinical characteristics and long-term prognosis of 11 Japanese  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients who were starting dialysis, we  studied the clinicopathological findings before dialysis and during the clinical  course after dialysis. Patients were divided into three groups: Group A  consisting of temporary dialysis patients (n = 5); Group B consisting of  early-death patient (n = 1); and Group C consisting of maintenance dialysis  patients (n = 6). At the start of dialysis, the progression pattern of renal  failure in all Group A patients was either acute exacerbation of chronic renal  failure (CRF) or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The pattern in  Group C was mostly CRF (83%). Three patients from Group A and three from Group C  were still alive at the latest follow-up (mean follow-up period was 11.0 years,  ranging from 1.8 to 16.2 years) and they showed no signs of clinical or  serological activity. Infection was the cause of death in 3 of the 5 patients who  died. We suggest that dialysis can be discontinued in patients with SLE who  receive dialysis for acute exacerbation of CRF or RPGN. After the initiation of  dialysis, patients tend to show diminished SLE activity. Infection is the major  contributor to the poor prognosis of SLE patients receiving dialysis.

SP  - 501-25
AB  - Connective tissue diseases (CTDs) typically have a wide spectrum of symptoms that  vary widely over time, often requiring a large array of medications and  laboratory tests. This presents a challenge in all stages of database  development, including the selection of data elements, collection methods, coding  of variables, and selection of a relational database with the potential for  tracking. There is a distinct need for valid, reliable data in a usable form to  assist in the diagnosis, management, and research of CTDs. This article discusses  the factors involved, provides examples of data collection tools that are  presently used, and suggests how they might be employed by the physician in  diagnosis and management of CTDs.

T1  - Quinidine-induced rheumatic syndromes.
SP  - 315-22
AB  - Quinidine is a commonly used antiarrhythmic agent that is rarely associated with  rheumatologic toxicity. However, quinidine-induced lupus, antinuclear antibody  negative lupus-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica-like illness, muscle  weakness, and isolated creatine phosphokinase elevation have all been reported.  We present one case of quinidine drug-induced lupus and another of a  quinidine-induced polymyalgia rheumatica-like illness, and review the English  literature for rheumatologic toxicity due to quinidine. Prompt recognition of  quinidine associated rheumatologic toxicity is important because discontinuation  of the medication leads to rapid resolution of clinical symptoms.

T1  - Parvovirus infection mimicking systemic lupus erythematosus.
SP  - 297-303
AB  - There are striking similarities between human parvovirus B19 (HPV-B19) infection  and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): both may present with malar rash, fever,  arthropathy, myalgia, cytopenia, hypocomplementemia, anti-DNA, and antinuclear  antibodies (ANA). Therefore, it is difficult at times to differentiate HPV-B19  infection from SLE presentation or exacerbation. We report 4 cases of HPV-B19  infection mimicking SLE and review 10 other reported cases, all of whom were  women. The similarity to a typical SLE presentation was indeed striking: most  patients presented with rash, arthropathy, myalgia, fever, and positive ANA. In  some cases, HPV-B19 infection seemed to exacerbate SLE rather then resemble it,  and differentiation was difficult. Nearly all patients improved within several  weeks. However, a few patients had symptoms and laboratory abnormalities lasting  more than 6 months. The possibility of HPV-B19 infection should be entertained in  patients presenting with SLE-like features.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by thrombotic microangiopathy.
SP  - 173-82
AB  - Seven patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or SLE-like disease  developed thrombotic microangiopathy. Prominent features of their acute illnesses  were microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (7), thrombocytopenia (7), fever (1),  nervous system disease (4), and renal dysfunction (5). Laboratory data were  significant for antinuclear antibody (ANA) (7), DNA (5), low C3 level (3), low C4  level (2), antiphospholipid antibody (6), schistocytes (7), and lactate  dehydrogenase > 500 (7). All seven patients received treatment that initially  included steroids but later included cyclophosphamide (4), plasma infusion (1),  plasmapheresis (5), intravenous gamma-globulin (2), anti-platelet agents (2), or  vincristine (3). Six patients improved, and one patient expired during treatment.  Of the six patients who survived this complication, three expired within the year  following their acute illnesses. Histology, available in two cases, showed  vascular changes consistent with a microangiopathic process. We conclude that the  spectrum of vascular diseases in SLE extends beyond vasculitis to include  noninflammatory vascular processes that can cause equally devastating  complications.

SP  - 1598-602
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this retrospective study of 136 patients was to specify  the natural history and the systemic prognosis of chronic cutaneous lupus  erythematosus. It has been stated that in most of the cases, the disease only  affects the skin. METHODS: From 10 October 1980 to 31 December 1990, 136 patients  with the following criteria were included in this retrospective study: clinical  signs suggestive of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, characteristic  histology, insufficient evidence for the diagnosis of systemic lupus  erythematosus. RESULTS: The prevalence of systemic clinical involvement in the  population under study was nearly the same as in the general population. The  following biologic or immunologic abnormalities were quite common: leukopenia,  lymphopenia, thrombopenia (significantly more frequent among patients having  widespread chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus), low titers of complement  levels, positive antinuclear antibodies (usually at a low titer). Eleven out of  the 136 patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus, most often over 5 years  after the onset of the cutaneous lesions. Four cases out of these 11 had poor  prognosis: renal and/or neurologic involvement. CONCLUSION: This data suggests  that patients with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus could benefit from  long-term follow up, since the course to systemic disease occurs in only a few.  Usually, antimalarials used singly or in combination with topical steroids may  lead to the clearing of the lesions. Thalidomide will occasionally be useful  whenever the disease is unresponsive to the preceding measures.

T1  - Indicators of disease activity, prognosis, and treatment of systemic lupus 
SP  - 487-92
AB  - In this article, assessment of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), including available instruments and their use in patients with SLE, is  discussed. Several validated measures, including the SLAM (Systemic Lupus  Activity Measure), SLEDAI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index),  LAI (Lupus Activity Index), ECLAM (European Consensus Lupus Activity  Measurement), and that of the BILAG (British Isles Lupus Activity Group) are now  available and should be included in studies of new laboratory measures,  therapeutic trials, and studies of outcome and prognosis. The prognosis of SLE  has improved over the past 4 decades, including 20-year survival rates. With  improved survival, other outcome measures such as specific organ function and  health status need to be considered. Administration of hydroxychloroquine remains  an important part of therapy for SLE. The use of cyclophosphamide should be  reserved for severe manifestations of the disease. Newer forms of therapy,  particularly immunotherapy, have been tested in animal models.

T1  - Autoimmune myelofibrosis. A steroid-responsive cause of bone marrow fibrosis 
SP  - 145-52
AB  - Autoimmune myelofibrosis is an uncommon disorder in which patients present with  anemia and thrombocytopenia in conjunction with limited clinical manifestations  of autoimmune disease or an exacerbation of previously established SLE. The  presence of leukoerythroblastosis in a patient with SLE may suggest the presence  of myelofibrosis. Conversely, the absence of splenomegaly in a patient with  presumed idiopathic myelofibrosis may suggest an autoimmune etiology. Patients  with autoimmune myelofibrosis universally have a positive ANA test and frequently  have either elevated anti-DNA titers or a positive LE cell preparation. Because  physical manifestations of autoimmune disease may not be evident at presentation,  all patients found to have myelofibrosis should have an ANA test. Peripheral  blood cytopenias in autoimmune myelofibrosis frequently respond to  glucocorticoids but regression of bone marrow fibrosis may be incomplete.  Hematologic response to treatment parallels that of the associated autoimmune  disease.

SP  - 305-17
AB  - A register of systemic lupus erythematosus has been open between 1st January 1987  and 31 December 1992 in France. One hundred and seventeen cases of pregnancy from  more than 40 centers origin have been prospectively collected. One hundred and  three were analyzed. Pregnancy outcome was as following: full term birth (n =  28), premature birth (n = 48), fetal wastage (n = 18 i.e. 13 early spontaneous  abortions, two late spontaneous abortions and three stillbirths), therapeutic  abortion (n = 5), elective abortion for unwanted pregnancy (n = 4). Four preterm  babies died in neo-natal period. Lupus activity was present at pregnancy  diagnosis in 28 cases (27%). Of 75 patients with inactive lupus at pregnancy  beginning, 27 relapsed during pregnancy and seven in post-partum period. Two  patients with nephrotic syndrome died of opportunistic infection. Fetal prognosis  is mostly related to proteinuria and absence of anti-SSA antibodies. History of  fetal losses, lupus activity at pregnancy beginning, hypertension, use of 20 mg/d  or more prednisone dosage during pregnancy influence prematurity. The fetal  hypotrophy factors are short duration of pregnancy, lupus activity at beginning  of pregnancy, low serum levels of C3 or C4, hypertension, absence of anti-SSA  antibodies. Three out of 22 newborns from mother with anti-SSA antibodies  developed neonatal lupus: two with cutaneous lupus and one with complete  congenital auriculo-ventricular block.

T1  - Lupus nephritis in childhood and adolescence.
SP  - 230-49
AB  - Lupus nephritis in childhood usually presents after the age of 10 years, and  presentation under 5 years is very rare. More males (F:M ratio 4.5:1) are  affected than in adult-onset cases, but the ratio is the same in prepubertal and  pubertal children. The incidence of clinically evident renal disease is greater  at onset than in adults (82%), the usual presentation being with proteinuria, 50%  having a nephrotic syndrome. Half the children show World Health Organisation  class IV nephritis in renal biopsies. Neuropsychiatric lupus is present at onset  in 30%, may complicate 50% at some point and remains a major problem. Prognosis  has improved greatly over the past 30 years, at least in part the result of  immunosuppressive treatment. Treatment of the initial phase may be guided by the  severity of the renal biopsy appearances, more aggressive treatment including  cytotoxic agents, i.v. methylprednisolone and perhaps plasma exchange, although  the value of exchange is not established. Controversy persists as to the most  effective cytotoxic treatment in the acute phase, both oral and i.v.  cyclophosphamide and azathioprine being used in different units. In the chronic  maintenance phase it seems established both clinically and histologically that  addition of a cytotoxic agent improves outcome, but again the drug and route of  administration are contentious. Azathioprine has the advantage of being safe for  pregnancy and not gonadotoxic, whilst i.v. cyclophosphamide has been demonstrated  to improve results over prednisolone alone in controlled trials and has  advantages in non-compliant patients. No trial comparing the two regimes has been  carried out, and one is needed. Today children much less commonly go into renal  failure, and the main causes of actual death (15% of patients over 10 years) are  now infections and extra-renal manifestations of lupus, principally neurological.  Morbidity of the disease and the treatment remain a major problem, especially  when treatment exacerbates complications of the disease itself, such as  infections, osteonecrosis, thrombosis, vascular disease and possibly neoplasia.

SP  - 385-93
AB  - We systematically investigated clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and pathologic  features, including treatment and prognosis, of stroke syndromes in 30 patients,  six from our institution and 24 from the literature, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) and symptomatic large cerebral vessel occlusive disease,  documented by angiography or autopsy. The average age at stroke onset was 35  years, and the diagnosis of SLE was made on average 4.4 years prior to that. At  least 86% had active SLE at the time of their stroke. Headache was common at  onset. We found major intracranial or extracranial vessel occlusive process by  (1) thrombus, (2) dissection, (3) fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitis, and (4)  atherosclerosis. The presumed mechanisms were coagulopathy, cardiogenic embolism,  large cerebral vessel vasculitis or occlusive vasculopathy, cervical arterial  dissection, and premature atherosclerosis. The short-term death rate was 40% and  the recurrent stroke rate was 13%. We conclude that symptomatic large cerebral  vessel occlusive disease in SLE generally occurs several years after the  diagnosis of SLE, usually during the active phase of the disease, is related to  heterogeneous mechanisms, and carries a relatively poor short-term outcome.

SP  - 465S-472S; discussion 472S-473S
AB  - Few treated chronic conditions preclude the ability of a mother to conceive.  However, consequences of the condition may undermine the pregnancy or aggravate  maternal disease. Most chronic conditions require nutritional intervention beyond  the normal needs of pregnancy. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are two common autoimmune disorders that  affect women of childbearing age. Little has been published about the long-term  consequences of current medication regimens for SLE and their interactions with  either nutrient metabolism or requirements. More information is available on  macronutrient dietary needs and metabolism during pregnancy and lactation in  women with IDDM, but little is published about the metabolism of other nutrients  in this condition. Thus, the nutritional consequences of treating these diseases  during pregnancy and lactation must be evaluated continually.

AB  - Neuropsychiatric disease occurs in up to two thirds of all systemic lupus  erythematosus patients. At present, there is no accepted classification for the  myriad of neuropsychiatric manifestations that can be divided into diffuse,  focal, and seizure presentations. Over the past decade, the pathogenesis of lupus  cerebritis has become better understood. Consequently, the approach to the  diagnosis and therapy can often be tailored to the suspected underlying  etiopathogenesis. Future advancements in therapy will further improve the  prognosis of patients with neuropsychiatric lupus erythematosus.

T1  - The course and treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 525-37
AB  - Renal involvement by systemic lupus is variable; some patients have minimal  clinical and histologic involvement, whereas others have fulminant renal failure  and severe proliferative renal lesions on biopsy. The World Health Organization  (WHO) classification has greatly aided in the study of lupus nephritis. This  classification defines six major patterns of renal involvement, each with  characteristic clinical correlates and a typical course and prognosis.  Transformations from one pattern of lupus nephritis to another may occur, and  there may also be prominent involvement of the tubulointerstitial compartment and  vasculature. Treatment of the renal lesions may be directed at the individual  class of lupus nephritis. Thus patients with mesangial involvement (WHO Class II)  do not require therapy directed at their kidney lesions. Many patients with  biopsies showing focal proliferative disease (WHO Class III) and all patients  whose biopsies show diffuse proliferative lesions (WHO Class IV) require vigorous  treatment, which has included high-dose daily and alternate-day corticosteroids,  azathioprine, i.v. pulse methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, total lymphoid  irradiation, cyclosporine, and oral and i.v. cyclophosphamide. Controlled trials  have yielded reasonable evidence for the safety and efficacy of some treatments,  whereas others have been used only in uncontrolled studies. When used  judiciously, such vigorous therapy can improve the renal survival of patients  with severe lupus nephritis.

SP  - 480-7
AB  - Lupus nephritis is a major predictor of the prognosis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE). The present paper discusses lupus nephritis from clinical  and immunopathological points of view. Although recent advances in diagnosis and  treatment improve the prognosis of children with SLE, there remain many unsolved  clinical problems. One of the current topics in the treatment for SLE is  intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy which is effective even for the  steroid-resistant patients with severe lupus nephritis, at least for short-term  observation. Immunopathologically, the following issues are discussed: (i) The  C5b-9 terminal complement complex plays an important role in the pathogenesis of  lupus nephritis. The possible interaction of vitronectin and SP-40,40 is also  mentioned; (ii) A semi-quantitative analysis of the charge barrier of the  glomerular basement membrane reveals that the charge barrier dysfunction plays an  important role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in lupus nephritis. This study  also demonstrates that the charge of immune deposits is important for the  initiation of glomerular injury in lupus nephritis; (iii) It is demonstrated that  the histopathological diversity of lupus nephritis is based on biological  properties of nephritogenic auto-antibodies in murine lupus models.

AB  - Several instruments have been developed to assess disease activity in systemic  lupus erythematosus. Any study of a new laboratory measure, any therapeutic  trial, and any study of outcome and prognosis should include one of these  validated measures of disease activity. The treatment of lupus is far from ideal.  A controlled trial of plasmapheresis showed no benefit over standard regimens in  lupus nephritis. A long course of pulse cyclophosphamide was shown to be better  than pulse methylprednisolone or a short course of intravenous pulse  cyclophosphamide. Despite the lack of ideal therapy, the prognosis of lupus,  including 15-year survival rates, has improved over the past 4 decades. Specific  organ damage continues to be an issue. Infection and vascular disease have  emerged as important factors. With improved survival, other outcome measures,  including specific organ function and health status, must be considered.

AB  - Autoimmunity to C7 is a genetically predisposed condition that results in the  production of predominantly IgG class basement membrane autoantibodies that may  cause basement membrane damage and subepidermal blisters by at least two  pathogenic mechanisms. Autoimmunity to C7 cuts across traditional disease  classifications (EBA versus bullous SLE), presents with heterogeneous clinical  and pathologic features, mimics other diseases, and may be difficult to diagnose  and treat. Autoimmunity to C7 is associated with susceptibility to SLE and  perhaps inflammatory bowel disease.

SP  - 582-7
AB  - The authors summarize contemporary views on the relationship between pregnancy  and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in women of reproductive age. It is known  that pregnancy influences in a marked way the basic disease and conversely the  disease has an impact on the course of pregnancy. Risks ensuing from these in  errelations for women--mothers with SLE and the foetus are exacerbation  (flare-up) of the basic disease, loss of the foetus and damage of the foetus by  so-called "lupus neonatorum" with skin symptoms and complete cardiac A-V block.  The contemporary state of knowledge makes it possible under certain conditions to  achieve by therapeutic interventions the development and delivery of a healthy  foetus. Among these views it is most important for conception to occur in these  patients with SLE during a period without signs of active SLE. To ensure a  successful course of pregnancy in women with SLE is the task of a team of  appropriate specialists.

AB  - The prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus has improved over the past four  decades. We now have data for 15-year survival, which has also improved. Several  factors may be associated with improved survival, including earlier diagnosis,  better treatment, and improved medical therapy. Specific organ damage continues  to be an issue, primarily with regard to kidney disease and to neurocognitive  impairment and lung involvement. Infection and vascular disease emerge as  important factors. With improved survival, other outcome measures, including  specific organ function and health status, need to be considered.

T1  - Mixed connective tissue disease--goodbye to all that.
SP  - 695-700
AB  - Since it was first described mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) has been the  subject of much debate. In particular the question of whether it is a truly  distinctive disease entity has been challenged. It seems clear that the original  description of MCTD as a mild disorder, rarely affecting the lungs or kidneys and  requiring small doses of corticosteroids only, is no longer tenable. In this  review a historical analysis of the clinical and serological features is  presented. It is suggested that the concept of MCTD as a distinct disease entity  is better replaced by the term 'undifferentiated autoimmune rheumatic/connective  tissue disorder'. Many of these patients will later 'convert' into scleroderma or  lupus; some will remain undifferentiated.

SP  - 192-4
AB  - Certain subgroups of lupus patients and those with circulating antiphospholipid  antibodies (aPL) in particular, suffer a high rate of fetal loss. Over the past 4  years, we have prospectively studied 100 pregnancies in patients with systemic  lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome. In addition to  conventional methods of monitoring SLE and fetal development, we have also used  Doppler flow assessment of placental perfusion from the 14th wk of pregnancy  onward. Patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome and previous history of  thrombotic events were treated with daily heparin (10,000 IU) and low-dose  aspirin (75 mg). Those without a history of thrombosis were treated with low-dose  prednisolone, azathioprine, or hydroxychloroquine. Pregnancy loss was reduced  from 81.3% in 101 previous pregnancies to 36.8% in 100 pregnancies managed by us.  None of the patients who received hydroxychloroquine throughout the pregnancy  presented fetal malformations. Careful management and close monitoring of the  lupus pregnancy has substantially improved fetal outcome.

SP  - 188-91
AB  - The course of pregnancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is not  known. The Hopkins Lupus Pregnancy Center has followed 64 patients (74  pregnancies) prospectively since 1987. Patients are seen monthly and clinical and  pregnancy-related data collected, with particular emphasis on the occurrence of  lupus flare. Flare rate during pregnancy was 1.63 per person-year, compared to  0.64-0.65 after delivery or in non-pregnant patients. Flare did not influence  pregnancy outcome. Low serum C3 or C4 and high anticardiolipin antibody predicted  pregnancy loss, and prednisone dose, aspirin use, diastolic second trimester  blood pressure, C3 at first visit, and race predicted preterm birth. Maternal  flare and preterm birth are important risks in lupus pregnancy. The latter can be  predicted from maternal pregnancy data.

AB  - We report a 73-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in whom  intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage developed secondary to a ruptured  aneurysm on the peripheral branch of the posterior cerebral artery. We reviewed  data on 22 patients (43 aneurysms) in previous reports of ruptured cerebral  aneurysms associated with SLE, including our case. Of these aneurysms, 34 (79.1%)  were located on the major artery, and 9 (20.9%) were located on the peripheral  small artery. Fusiform aneurysms accounted for 27.9% of the total. The prognosis  was poor, and 14 patients (63.6%) died. Direct aneurysmal surgery was performed  in 11 patients (50%), but 4 patients died of other diseases associated with SLE.

AB  - Real or suspected brain involvement occurs in the majority of patients with  systemic lupus erythematosus. The clinical manifestations are myriad and are  accounted for by diverse pathogenic mechanisms. Purely psychological disturbances  and psychiatric syndromes with organic components account for the majority of  cases. Metabolic disturbances, drug effects, and infections may masquerade for  immune-related brain dysfunction. In the absence of reliable and specific  indicators of lupus brain activity, successful management requires the combined  skills and clinical judgment of the rheumatologist, neurologist, and  psychiatrist.

AB  - In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in remission pregnancy has a good  prognosis for mother and foetus. Pregnancy does not have a negative effect on  systemic lupus erythematosus in remission, either in the short or the long term.  Immuno-regulatory drugs should not be withdrawn before or after start of  pregnancy, and flares during pregnancy can be treated with steroids and/or  azathioprine. The risk of flare is very high in the puerperium, and can be  prevented by steroids. All patients are at high risk of losing the foetus,  particularly patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients at high risk  should be given low doses of aspirin (80 mg daily) from the first day of  pregnancy. Neonatal lupus and congenital heart block are rare, and are associated  with the presence of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies in the maternal blood.

AB  - Genetic aspects of lupus are reviewed, including recognition of genetic and  clinical heterogeneity, genetic factors in the aetiology and heritability of  disease, reproductive implications and genetic counselling of patients. Despite a  large literature on the genetic epidemiology and immunogenetics of lupus, it  remains difficult to apply the results of laboratory findings to the  circumstances of individual patients. Generally, lupus is not transmitted as a  simple Mendelian trait, and genetic counselling is based on the multifactorial  model of disease aetiology with interaction of multiple genetic and environmental  factors. Further studies are needed to clarify the heritability of lupus and  improve the data for recurrence risk prediction in lupus families.

AB  - The reported change in the incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is  mainly due to a greater awareness of the disease, and to the introduction of  serological detection methods such as the LE cell assay and subsequently a  variety of other antinuclear antibody assays. SLE is seldom preceded by  rheumatoid arthritis, nor does SLE often develop in patients with rheumatoid  arthritis. In a substantial proportion of our SLE patients, discoid LE occurred  first. On analyzing the literature no evidence could be found that nowadays less  severe SLE is diagnosed. Also, in the last three decades no change has been  observed in the prevalence of clinical features in large groups of patients with  SLE. These data indicate that there has been no change in the expression or  prognosis of SLE in recent decades.

Since specific  diagnostic tests for these autoimmune diseases are not available, diagnosis  depends on the presence of defined criteria. Drug therapy in JDMS consists of  prednisone at a low dosage (1 mg/kg/day). In SLE different therapeutic approaches  are known depending on the occurrence of life threatening symptoms. The prognosis  of MCTD is good, it is of prime importance to avoid overdosage of  corticosteroids, since drug treatment is often not needed.

AB  - The prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus has improved over the past four  decades. Articles published in the past year continue to demonstrate this  improved survival, both overall and in patients with renal disease. Several  factors may be associated with improved survival, including earlier diagnosis,  better treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus, and improved medical therapy  in general. Hydroxychloroquine has now clearly been shown to prevent flares, and  ancrod has been shown to improve renal disease in patients with glomerular  thrombosis. Treatment with dialysis and transplantation resulted not only in  improved survival but also in improved renal status, and reduction in overall  disease activity. Specific organ damage continues to be an issue, primarily with  regard to kidney disease and neurocognitive impairment. The inclusion of health  status assessment in the evaluation of patients with lupus, and as an outcome  measure, is discussed.

AB  - In the past 40 years an impressive improvement in the prognosis of SLE patients  has occurred. Factors which might be responsible for this improvement are  discussed. Two of the factors most frequently cited are the advances in disease  recognition and treatment. However, as already noted by Albert (1979) this is  questionable, as average disease duration and survival have increased in a linear  fashion related to the number of publications devoted to this subject from 1950  on. Further evaluation of the literature shows that the most prominent factors  which have an impact on the survival rate are specific disease manifestations  (lupus nephritis) and the overall disease course (number of exacerbations). This  effect of morbidity on the survival rate is greater than that of factors such as  sex and race. Socio-economic factors or age at onset have no effect on the  outcome.

T1  - Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy.
SP  - 121-5
AB  - This article critically analyses the data in the literature on pregnancy in women  with systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on the results of recent controlled  prospective studies, it is apparent that the long-standing opinion that pregnancy  induces exacerbation of the disease should be revised. The presence of active  disease and/or a significant loss of renal function at conception are not only  associated with a high risk of maternal complications, but also with high  frequencies of loss of the fetus, as well as pre- and dysmaturity. Recently, the  presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, notably the lupus anticoagulant and  anticardiolipin antibodies, has been recognized as being important for the  occurrence of death of the fetus, in particular, late in the pregnancy. This is  probably due to thrombosis occurring in the placental vessels. However, the  results of randomized studies on treatment with antithrombotic drugs and/or  procedures lowering, antibody levels must be available before we will know  whether the presence of these antibodies should be coupled to specific  instructions or not. Although there is a strong association between the neonatal  lupus syndrome and the presence of anti-SSA antibodies in maternal blood, the  finding of anti-SSA antibodies has up to now had no therapeutic implications. It  is concluded that pregnancy in SLE deserves extensive preconceptional counseling  and close cooperation between the internist, rheumatologist, obstetrician and the  neonatologist.

T1  - Anti-dsDNA: choice of assay in relation to clinical value.
SP  - 101-7
AB  - Antibodies to DNA are quite specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and  occur in the majority of SLE patients. Therefore, their detection is an important  diagnostic aid to the clinician. Detection of anti-dsDNA may precede the  diagnosis of SLE by more than a year. Fluctuations in the level of anti-dsDNA in  an individual patient may give important information on the clinical status of  the patient. Four of the most important methods developed for the measurement of  anti-dsDNA antibodies will be discussed in this paper: the Farr assay, the PEG  assay, the indirect immunofluorescence test on Crithidia luciliae and the ELISA.  They will also be compared with one commercially available (Farr) assay, the  Amersham anti-dsDNA kit. Each method, detects a part of the spectrum of  anti-dsDNA antibodies produced by a patient. The Farr assay is the most specific  for SLE; however, milder forms of the disease in which patients have only low  avidity anti-dsDNA may easily be missed by this technique. Clinically, high  avidity anti-dsDNA is related more frequently to the occurrence of nephritis,  whereas low avidity anti-dsDNA antibodies are found more often in patients with  central nervous system involvement. Traditionally, SLE is considered an  immune-complex disease, in which inflammatory processes are initiated by local  deposition of DNA/anti-dsDNA complexes. More recently, a major role was thought  to be played by crossreactions of anti-dsDNA with tissue constituents. Our  current view, however, is that such a crossreactivity plays only a minor role; we  postulate that binding to glomerular constituents is caused by anti-dsDNA  antibodies complexed with DNA and histones.

SP  - 1920-9
AB  - Acute systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by a variety of  manifestations and by the almost constant presence of anti-nuclear antibodies. In  order to distinguish it from other systemic diseases, eleven diagnostic criteria  have been laid down, four of which at least must be present. In 50 p. 100 of the  cases the disease is revealed by a non-destructive inflammatory polyarthritis  which is highly suggestive when associated with a "butterfly" facial erythema.  The main prognostic criteria are renal lesions and their histological type.  Nervous system involvement seems to be less frequent and less severe nowadays,  but it may leave sequelae. Pleuropericarditis and vascular thrombosis are  commonly part of the clinical set up. Antinuclear antibodies are detected by  immunofluorescence in more than 95 p. 100 of the patients, but they are not  specific to SLE. Their absence in the initial phase of the disease may throw  doubts on the diagnosis. Antibodies to DNA and Sm are more specific but  inconstant. SLE is a chronic disease with intermittent flare-ups: 30 p. 100 of  the patients may hope for a prolonged complete remission. At present, the  survival rate at 10 and 20 years is higher than 80 p. 100 and 70 p. 100  respectively at the cost of a very close supervision but also of iatrogenic  complications in increasing numbers.

AB  - Descriptive epidemiologic studies of SLE have been conducted worldwide; the most  extensive data are available for Scandinavia, especially Sweden, and the United  States. In the United States, blacks have threefold higher incidence, prevalence,  and mortality rates compared with whites; the reasons for this excess, however,  remain unknown. Analytic and genetic epidemiologic studies suggest a  multifactorial etiology of SLE; results support a polygenic mode of inheritance  including important roles for an autosomal dominant "autoimmune" gene and female  sex hormones. Although a viral etiology remains attractive, there is little  evidence to support such a hypothesis. Rather, other environmental factors  including chemical exposures may be important as "triggers" of disease. Finally,  observational epidemiologic studies demonstrate an increasingly favorable  prognosis for patients with SLE, allowing a better understanding of long-term  morbidity and impact on overall health status. Future epidemiologic studies  should focus on identifying noninfectious environmental etiologic factors and  improving the quality of life for all patients with SLE.

SP  - 174-82
AB  - Neuropsychiatric alterations appear in 14-75% of lupic patients. Verified in 59%  of the patients, psychiatric changes are the most frequent. Psychic symptoms are  primarily related to the disease and secondary to uremia, hypertension,  infection, and corticosteroids. Manifestations were also seen as a reaction to  this chronic disease, which are potentially severe and causing many limitations  to the patients. The authors review the literature considering the  multidisciplinary aspects of this disease related to its pathogenesis, clinical  features, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment.

T1  - [Have lupus characteristics changed?].
SP  - 265-8
AB  - The features of lupus have been changing for 30 years. The aim of this study was  to determine the main modifications and to search for the possible causes. Lupus  epidemiology, the clinical symptoms and the prognostic subsets were investigated.  The rising incidence of lupus closely paralleled improvements in diagnostic  techniques (LE cell testing, anti-nuclear antibodies) but has since remained  stable. The prevalence progressively increased over this time, but this evolution  is associated with better detection of benign subsets and improvement in the  management of the disease and its complications. More sensitive serological  methods have attributed new symptoms to lupus, revealing that some forms are  benign. Survival has been improving and infection has become the primary cause of  death. Opportunistic infections in lupus are increasing, however the majority of  them remain undiagnosed until the autopsy.

T1  - The clinical and renal biopsy predictors of long-term outcome in lupus nephritis: 
SP  - 779-833
AB  - The prognostic markers in 87 consecutive patients with lupus nephritis who  underwent renal biopsy are reported for five clinically relevant long-term  outcomes--renal insufficiency, renal failure, death due to renal systemic lupus  erythematosus, death due to non-renal SLE and death due to SLE, both renal and  non-renal. We have demonstrated that a number of previously neglected or rarely  studied predictors were important prognostic markers. These included the duration  of renal disease before biopsy, overall severity of SLE, as well as the presence  of vasculitis, hypertension or a comorbid ailment. Furthermore, the study  confirms the predictive importance of serum creatinine, 24-h urinary excretion of  protein, C3, and of the activity and chronicity indices on biopsy. However,  overall a simple measure of tubulointerstitial disease was the best predictor  obtained from biopsy. Prognostic models based on clinical data alone were  developed for each of the five outcomes. The models amplify our clinical  understanding of lupus nephritis. Markers of renal severity were most important  in predicting renal outcomes such as renal insufficiency and renal failure.  Prognostic factors less directly related to renal disease (comorbidity and  vasculitis) were important predictors of fatality. A marker of immunologic  disease activity (C3) was a valuable predictor for many of the outcomes. Thus  markers of disease severity reflecting organ damage due to SLE and other comorbid  conditions could be combined with markers of immunologic activity to predict a  variety of outcomes of relevance to a clinician. When biopsy data obtained by  light or electron microscopy were evaluated for their ability to add new  predictive information to the clinical models, only a limited value for biopsy  was noted. It is likely that this reflected the close correlational relationships  between clinical and biopsy variables, the strong clinical models generated, and  the inclusion in the clinical models of the previously neglected clinical  variables, duration of renal disease before biopsy and the presence of vasculitis  or comorbid disease.

AB  - Experience with more than 150 pregnancies of women with systemic lupus  erythematosus demonstrates that: many conventional measures of lupus activity,  including complement, platelet count and urinary protein, are invalid during  pregnancy; pregnancy does not cause lupus exacerbation; anti-phospholipid  antibody is common and is closely associated with fetal loss, but is not the sole  determinant factor of fetal loss; specific characteristics of anti-phospholipid  antibody do not identify which antibody-positive women will have poor fetal  outcome; prednisone therapy does not improve fetal prognosis; and neonatal lupus,  diagnosed by rash and thrombocytopenia, is common but congenital heart block is  rare.

SP  - 563-6
AB  - Renal disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood onset  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Renal biopsy findings have some predictive  value for renal function; however, this is not significantly greater than can be  obtained from routine clinical laboratory investigations. Renal biopsy in  childhood SLE should usually be restricted to: a) The child with nephrotic  syndrome, so as to distinguish between membranous and diffuse proliferative  glomerulonephritis, which have different prognoses and steroid responsiveness, b)  The child with deteriorating renal function, to assess the degree of irreversible  renal damage, c) The child being entered into a controlled clinical trial.

AB  - The management of the patient with lupus nephropathy is still difficult. A new  classification considering activity and chronicity indexes has revalued the  histologic assessment as a prognostic and therapeutic guide. The benefits of  immunosuppressive drugs in preventing progression of renal disease have been  clarified and adverse effects reduced by new methods of administration. A key  aspect of therapy is still individual selection of type and intensity of  immunosuppression, that must be adjusted to the changing nature of the disease.  Therapy must be balanced between optimal levels of efficacy and minimal toxicity.

T1  - The treatment of lupus nephritis.
SP  - 350-62
AB  - The literature on the treatment of lupus nephritis is scattered, much of it in  rheumatological rather than nephrological journals. Whatever our ignorance of the  nature and genesis of lupus nephritis, under empirical treatment the prognosis,  especially for severe forms, has improved dramatically during the past 20 years.  For severe lupus nephritis, the evidence that the addition of cytotoxic agents to  corticosteroids improves outcome is now secure, and discussion centres mainly on  which drug to use and by what route. Intravenous methylprednisolone is at least  as effective as high-dose tapering oral therapy for initial treatment, and  carries fewer side-effects. The role of plasma exchange in lupus remains  undefined: it may have a role in the treatment of cerebral manifestations or  otherwise resistant patients, but controlled trials have failed to show benefit.  Future developments will probably centre around the use of specific monoclonal  antibodies which target specific groups and subgroups of cells, "humanised" by  the splicing of human Fc piece to rodent (fab)2, perhaps bearing toxins. To use  these agents to best advantage, however, we will have to understand better than  we do today the nature of the cellular defects in the immune response which  underlie the lupus syndrome.

T1  - Autoimmune disease in pregnancy.
SP  - 605-21
AB  - Autoimmunity, whether present in a recognized syndrome such as systemic lupus  erythematosus or represented by the production of subclasses of autoantibodies,  adversely affects reproduction. While fertility of patients with autoimmune  disorders is generally unimpaired, important exceptions exist. Recent data  regarding the impact of intercurrent pregnancy upon women with SLE suggest that  the overall course of this disorder is not affected. The impact of SLE and  related autoimmune phenomena during pregnancy primarily relates to adverse fetal  outcome. Pregnancy wastage is excessive, and premature delivery and poor fetal  growth are commonly encountered. The occurrence of fetal complications correlates  with the level of maternal disease activity and the presence of specific  autoantibodies. Management of pregnancy complicated by SLE or the production of  autoantibodies associated with poor reproductive outcome should be directed at  maintaining maternal disease quiescence. The adverse effect of the maternal  disorder on fetal growth and development far outweighs actual or theoretical  risks attributable to maternal drug therapy.

AB  - Two patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presented with anasarca,  pleural effusions and severe hypoalbuminema. Both were demonstrated to have  protein-losing enteropathy, a rare complication of SLE. Other causes of  gastrointestinal protein loss were excluded. There were marked similarities in  both cases including circulating ANF with speckled staining, anti-(U1)RNP  antibodies and low serum complement levels. Complete remission was achieved in  both with prednisolone. Anti-(U1)RNP may be a marker for a subset of SLE in which  protein-losing enteropathy is a major manifestation.

SP  - 183-5
AB  - In patients with SLE in remission pregnancy does not confer a special risk to  either the mother or foetus, and immunoregulatory drugs should not be withdrawn  prior to a pregnancy where these are required for disease control. Likewise  therapy to treat disease flares during pregnancy should not be withheld as the  foetus is at comparitively more risk from the effects of the maternal disease  than from the small risk associated with therapy. Patients with active disease  should be counselled against pregnancy but therapeutic abortion in such patients  is only very rarely indicated. High risk groups benefit from close monitoring  though the previous obstetric history will not necessarily reflect outcome in  subsequent pregnancies. Patients without a previous obstetric history should not  be treated prophylactically due to the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies,  and the optimum treatment for those with poor histories and aPL is currently  being investigated.

AB  - Issues concerning contraception, fertility, and pregnancy usually arise during a  typical lupus patient's disease course. Pregnancy superimposed on established  lupus may alter the course of the disease, and, conversely, lupus may affect the  natural history of pregnancy. Two recently described autoantibody markers,  anti-SSA (Ro) and anticardiolipin, have provided new insights concerning fetal  risks in these patients. Furthermore, they should lead to improved understanding  of mechanisms of tissue injury and to new ideas about therapeutic interventions  and/or prevention of pregnancy complications.

SP  - 117-33
AB  - Lupus nephritis is the archetype of diseases caused by the deposition of immune  complexes. The characteristics which render only a portion of circulating immune  complexes nephritogenic are not well delineated, but cat-ionic charge of antigen  and/or antibody may contribute. Lupus nephritis is characterized by extreme  diversity of clinical manifestations and pathologic features. Scrupulous  monitoring of urinary sediment and renal function tests is necessary to identify  renal involvement in a phase which is amenable to therapeutic intervention.  Evaluation of renal biopsies also assists in development of indications for  therapy. The pathology of lupus nephritis is classified primarily as mesangial,  focal proliferative, diffuse proliferative, and membranous nephropathy. Indexes  of activity and of chronicity provide a succinet description of the balance of  reversible and irreversible disease. The activity index incorporates glomerular  hypercellularity, karyorrhexis/fibrinoid necrosis, leucocyte exudation, hyaline  thrombi, cellular crescents, and interstitial inflammation. The chronicity index  incorporates glomerular sclerosis, fibrous crescents, tubular atrophy, and  interstitial fibrosis. Delineation of the activity and chronicity indexes also  facilitates the assessment of prognosis and the ordering of indications for  therapy.

AB  - The prevalence of SLE has increased throughout the world, due in part to the  recognition of milder forms. Significant renal disease is now less common but  late cardiovascular disease is being reported more often. The latter was  previously attributed to steroid therapy, but we believe that the thrombotic  tendency associated with antiphospholipid antibodies provides a significant  contribution. Infection still ranks high in the mortality statistics in SLE,  despite the move to more conservative treatment.

SP  - 19-25
AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension may develop in patients with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) in the absence of lung tissue lesion or embolism in the  pulmonary circulation. Its mechanisms and prognosis are imperfectly known,  although various suggestions have been made concerning the possible role of  pulmonary arterial spasm, immune complex arteritis or arterial wall fibrosis. We  report two cases of SLE in female patients who presented with clinical signs of  pulmonary arterial hypertension. The fact that pulmonary arterial hypertension  regressed completely in one patient and resulted in death in the other points to  different pathogenic mechanisms. In the first patient the dramatic therapeutic  effectiveness of a calcium inhibitor suggests that an arterial spasm was  involved, whereas the anatomical lesions found in the second patient are in  favour of a fibrotic inflammatory arteritis. This pathogenic heterogeneity of  pulmonary arterial hypertension in SLE, which may correspond to different  evolutive stages of the disease, is documented by a review of the literature with  special attention to the frequency and to the clinical biochemical, haemodynamic  and histological aspects of this complication of SLE.

AB  - The follow-up of 43 patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis is  reported. After histological diagnosis, all patients were treated with 3  intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone pulses and then with low-dose oral  steroids and 31 with cytotoxic drugs. Renal and extra-renal exacerbations were  also treated with intravenous high-dose steroids. Patients were followed for 1 to  13 years. At 10 years the patient survival rate was 87% and the kidney survival  rate was 79%. If 3 extra-renal deaths are excluded, the actuarial 10-year kidney  survival rate is 91%. At present, 21 patients do not show any renal  abnormalities, 13 patients have normal plasma creatinine but proteinuria, 3  patients have stable renal function impairment, 2 patients have worsening of  their renal function, 1 is on regular dialysis. The other 3 patients died (from  cardiac failure, cerebral hemorrhage and a car accident). The incidence of  flare-ups was low (0.1 episodes per year). Severe side effects were rare in this  series. It is concluded that the long-term prognosis of diffuse lupus nephritis  is becoming considerably better. Therapy based on a short course of intravenous  high-dose methylprednisolone and on a maintenance regimen with low doses of  steroid and cytotoxic agents can contribute to preserving renal function while  avoiding severe side effects.

AB  - Anatomical studies have demonstrated the high incidence of vasculitis in SLE, the  appearances of which are variable and non-specific, ranging from necrotizing  angiitis which is undistinguishable from periarteritis nodosa, to scarring  lesions. Micro-angiitis is easily demonstrated in skin lesions and is also  encountered to varying degrees in CNS, renal, cardiac, pulmonary and  gastrointestinal localisations. Disease of large vessels is more rare and  sometimes causes gangrene of the limbs. In SLE, vasculitis should be  distinguished from thrombosis related to lupus anticoagulant and from  atherosclerosis favoured by chronic steroid therapy but perhaps initiated by  vascular deposits of immune complexes during the acute inflammatory stage. The  treatment of lupic angiitis is mainly based on steroid therapy. The results are  variable, probably due to the fibrous nature of some of the vascular lesions.

T1  - Cardiovascular manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus: current 
SP  - 421-34
AB  - Cardiovascular manifestations develop in the majority of SLE patients at some  time during the course of their illness, the most common being acute fibrinous  pericarditis and pericardial effusion. Echocardiography has demonstrated an  increased incidence of pericardial effusion, even in those who have minimal  symptoms. Chronic adhesive pericarditis, pericardial tamponade, and constrictive  pericarditis occur rarely. While myocarditis is commonly noted at autopsy, it is  often silent clinically. Diagnosis during life can be confirmed only by  endomyocardial biopsy. Electrocardiographic changes are often nonspecific.  Endocarditis with superimposed nonbacterial verrucous vegetations (Libman-Sacks)  is noted in more than 40% of hearts at autopsy, but is rarely diagnosed during  life. Valve dysfunctions, such as aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency, mitral  stenosis, and mitral insufficiency, occasionally manifest during life and rarely  may necessitate surgery. Atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, first degree AV  block, and acquired CHB occur in association with pericarditis, myocarditis,  vasculitis, and myocardial fibrosis, respectively. CCHB developing in newborns of  mothers with SLE, particularly those who have an antibody to soluble tissue  ribonuclear protein RO(SS-A), is increasingly being appreciated by both pediatric  cardiologists and rheumatologists. Recently, severe coronary atherosclerosis  resulting in angina pectoris and/or myocardial infarction in young adults has  been noted, particularly in those who had developed risk factors such as  hypertension and hyperlipidemia while receiving prolonged corticosteroid therapy.  Rarely, coronary arteritis may produce similar symptoms. Congestive heart failure  of either single or multiple etiologies carries an ominous prognosis. It remains  a cause of high morbidity and mortality unless recognized early and treated  properly. Extracardiac vascular manifestations of SLE include telangiectasia,  vasculitis, livedo reticularis, Raynaud's phenomena, and thrombophlebitis, all of  which may occur either alone or in different combinations. Evidence is now slowly  accumulating that substantiates that immune complex deposition, complement  activation and subsequent inflammatory reaction is responsible for the majority  of the cardiovascular manifestations of SLE, for example, pericarditis,  myocarditis, endocarditis, coronary arteritis, coronary atherosclerosis, and  systemic and pulmonary vasculitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

T1  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus. A clinical, serological and immunogenetic study 
SP  - 362-78
AB  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is an inflammatory disorder of neonates  characterized by transient cutaneous lesions and/or congenital heart block. The  cutaneous lesions usually heal with minimal scarring, but healing may be delayed  for many months in occasional cases. Photosensitivity is recognized as a  component of this syndrome. A large proportion of this maternal population is  asymptomatic, although the mothers' potential risk for developing CTD in the  future remains to be determined. Moreover, this maternal group may exhibit a  tendency to fetal wastage. La(SSB) and/or Ro(SSA) antibody is almost universally  present in the sera of the neonatal lupus mothers and their infants. Since these  antibodies may have a pathogenetic role in NLE, screening of infants with  isolated CHB and/or cutaneous lesions suggestive of LE, and their mothers, for  the presence of Ro(SSA) and La(SSB) antibodies is strongly recommended. HLA  studies reveal that infants of Ro-positive mothers bearing the HLA, A1, B8, DR3,  MB2 and MT2 phenotypes are at increased risk of developing neonatal lupus, in  sharp contrast to infants of Ro-positive mothers bearing the DR2 and/or MB1/MT1  phenotypes. Recognition of the protean manifestations of this complex disorder by  obstetricians, pediatricians, cardiologists, and dermatologists will undoubtedly  lead to increased detection of NLE and afford further opportunity to elucidate  more fully the etiology of this syndrome.

AB  - Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an uncommon type of lupus that in addition to  cutaneous lesions may have systemic involvement. It is generally a benign  condition unless complicated by complete heart block, which is irreversible and  which carries a high mortality rate in the first year of life. Patients' mothers  often show clinical and/or laboratory features of connective tissue diseases.

Their relevance in view of SLE-subclassification is discussed.  Antibodies directed against histone and Sm, and--with some restriction--against  Ro/La also are valuable tools in immunological characterization of SLE.  Antibodies against La have only in association with anti-Ro-antibodies prognostic  importance.

SP  - 1791-6
AB  - When a woman with chronic renal disease wishes to become pregnant, the risk to  the mother and the foetus is often inaccurately evaluated or exaggerated. In  patients with primary nephropathy the foetal risk is significantly increased by  the arterial hypertension frequently associated with renal insufficiency. In  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement, the risk represented  by hypertension is compounded by a high incidence of spontaneous abortion,  particularly when the disease is progressive. Pregnancy seems to have little  influence on SLE itself, and the classical post-partum problems are  controversial. Much more dangerous are acute complications, such as cortical  necrosis or haemolytic and uraemic syndromes occurring in apparently healthy  women during the last trimester of pregnancy and after delivery. Urinary  infections are common during pregnancy. They are heralded by asymptomatic  bacteriuria which should be systematically detected, since these infections  increase the likelihood of pyelonephritis with in turn increases the severity of  perinatal complications.

SP  - 121-8
AB  - Since 1970 in 27 out of 46 patients with the diagnosis of systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE) a renal biopsy could be taken. The morphological outcome was  followed in 14 patients with a total of 18 repeated biopsies. By light- and  electron microscopy renal involvement was demonstrable in all patients. Four  histologic subgroups could be differentiated: Mesangio-proliferative (MESLN, 14),  focal proliferative (FLN, 6), diffus proliferative (DLN, 6), and membranous lupus  nephritis (MLN, 1). Some biopsies demonstrated linear deposits with  IgG/IgA-specificity. 2/27 patients only showed a clinical deteriorating course  with progressive renal insufficiency despite steroid or steroid-azathioprine  therapy. One patient with DLN died in terminal renal failure. The morphological  follow-up showed an unfavourable course in 3/14 patients only. One MESLN  demonstrated a transition to DLN, one DLN an increase of proliferative lesions  and a second DLN focal and local sclerosis. In our experience renal involvement  in SLE can adequately characterised and controlled by repeated be  clinico-pathological correlations an aggressive therapeutic regimen is not  indicated and can be avoided.

AB  - In recent years, evidence from several laboratories has indicated that various  subsets of systemic lupus erythematosus exist. Some of these subsets have  distinctive mucocutaneous features but more importantly they have different  prevalence of renal disease--thus different prognosis. These subsets are defined  by the specificity of the serum antibodies the SLE patient possesses.

All patients were  admitted to hospital electively for 2 days and a complete clinical and laboratory  assessment protocol completed. The overall mean observation period was 29 months.  Widespread multisystem involvement was found in every patient. Subclinical  abnormalities of respiratory and cerebral function were common. A more  conservative approach than has been generally recommended was used for the  management of systemic lupus erythematosus and is justified by 5-year survival of  98%.

SP  - 323-39
AB  - 1. Among patients with SLE, 71 (51%) had significant neuropsychiatric problems  during the course of the disease. In 52 (37%), the nervous system manifestations  were secondary to SLE. 2. The most frequent manifestations were psychiatric  dysfunction, seizures, long tract signs, cranial neuropathy, and peripheral  neuropathy. 3. Psychiatric abnormalities secondary to SLE were characterized by  organic features (present in 22 of 24) and by the association of neurologic  lesions which were often diffuse or multifocal. 4. An abnormal cerebrospinal  fluid was found in 32% of neuropsychiatric episodes in which specimens were  obtained. The most frequently abnormal study was the electroencephalogram (71%),  and the least frequent was the brain scan (8%). These studies did not correlate  with specific clinical patterns. 5. In 63% of the patients, NP manifestations  preceded the diagnosis of SLE or occurred within the first year of diagnosed  disease, and in most episodes were associated with evidence of clinical and/or  serologic activity of the underlying illness. 6. Only two clinical features  showed significant and striking correlations with neuropsychiatric involvement,  namely vasculitis and thrombocytopenia. The possible pathogenic implications have  been discussed. 7. Only 2 of the 140 patients were felt to have steroid-induced  psychoses. In approximately one-half of the NP episodes secondary to SLE,  patients were receiving no corticosteriods on presentation. Of those developing  while patients were on steroids, the majority occurred on low doses or after  tapering from higher levels. 8. The immediate prognosis for improvement in  neuropsychiatric function was good with 84% of episodes showing complete or  partial resolution. Corticosteroids appeared to be of benefit in a substantial  number of patients although their precise role is difficult to quantitate. 9.  Five and 10 years survivals for the overall population were 94% and 82%,  respectively. There were no significant differences in survival for patients with  or without nervous system involvement.

Its pathologic hallmark, vasculitis, is currently felt to be  the end result of an immune-complex mechanism. Several clinical and serologic  variants of SLE are recognized including discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), mixed  connective tissue disease (MCTD) and drug-induced equivalents-such as  procainamide-induced lupus (PIL). The distinguishing features of these variants  as well as their prognosis and therapy are discussed in relation to recent  developments in the immunopathogenesis of SLE.
