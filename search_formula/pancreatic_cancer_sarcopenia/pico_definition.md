# PICO Definition: Pancreatic Cancer and Sarcopenia

## Population (P)
**Target Population**: Patients with pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy

**Inclusion Criteria**:
- Patients diagnosed with pancreatic neoplasms
- All types of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma, ductal carcinoma, etc.)
- All stages of pancreatic cancer
- Adult patients (18+ years)

**Key Terms**:
- Pancreatic neoplasms
- Pancreatic cancer
- Pancreatic carcinoma
- Adenocarcinoma
- Ductal carcinoma
- IPMN (Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm)

## Intervention (I)
**Primary Intervention**: Chemotherapy treatment

**Specific Interventions**:
- Single-agent chemotherapy
- Combination chemotherapy protocols
- Chemoradiotherapy
- Standard chemotherapy regimens (FOLFIRINOX, FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, GEMOX)
- Individual agents (gemcitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, etc.)

**Key Terms**:
- Chemotherapy
- Antineoplastic protocols
- Fluoropyrimidines
- Gemcitabine
- FOLFIRINOX
- Chemoradiotherapy

## Comparison (C)
**Comparison Groups**: Not specifically defined - studies may include:
- Different chemotherapy regimens
- Chemotherapy vs. supportive care
- Before/after treatment comparisons
- Control groups without intervention

## Outcome (O)
**Primary Outcome**: Sarcopenia and muscle wasting

**Specific Outcomes**:
- Sarcopenia development or progression
- Muscle mass changes
- Skeletal muscle loss
- Body composition changes
- Cachexia
- Muscular atrophy

**Key Terms**:
- Sarcopenia
- Muscle wasting
- Muscle mass
- Skeletal muscle
- Body composition
- Cachexia
- Muscular atrophy

## Research Question
How does chemotherapy treatment affect sarcopenia and muscle wasting in patients with pancreatic cancer?

## Study Types
- Observational studies
- Cohort studies
- Case-control studies
- Cross-sectional studies
- Randomized controlled trials
- Clinical trials

## Rationale for MeSH Term Selection

### Pancreatic Cancer MeSH Terms
- **"Pancreatic Neoplasms"[Mesh]**: Primary MeSH term for all pancreatic cancers
- **"Adenocarcinoma"[Mesh]**: Most common type of pancreatic cancer
- **"Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal"[Mesh]**: Specific subtype of pancreatic adenocarcinoma

### Chemotherapy MeSH Terms
- **"Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols"[Mesh]**: Covers combination chemotherapy regimens
- **Individual drug MeSH terms**: "Fluorouracil", "Gemcitabine", "Irinotecan", "Oxaliplatin", "Paclitaxel", "Mitomycin", "Doxorubicin", "Leucovorin", "Capecitabine"

### Sarcopenia/Muscle Wasting MeSH Terms
- **"Sarcopenia"[Mesh]**: Primary term for age-related muscle loss
- **"Muscular Atrophy"[Mesh]**: General term for muscle wasting
- **"Muscle, Skeletal"[Mesh]**: Anatomical term for skeletal muscle
- **"Body Composition"[Mesh]**: Includes muscle mass measurements
- **"Cachexia"[Mesh]**: Cancer-related wasting syndrome
